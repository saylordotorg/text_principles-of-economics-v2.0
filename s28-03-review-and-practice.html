        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch10_s03_p01">We began this chapter by looking at bond and foreign exchange markets and showing how each is related to the level of real GDP and the price level. Bonds represent the obligation of the seller to repay the buyer the face value by the maturity date; their interest rate is determined by the demand and supply for bonds. An increase in bond prices means a drop in interest rates. A reduction in bond prices means interest rates have risen. The price of the dollar is determined in foreign exchange markets by the demand and supply for dollars.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch10_s03_p02">We then saw how the money market works. The quantity of money demanded varies negatively with the interest rate. Factors that cause the demand curve for money to shift include changes in real GDP, the price level, expectations, the cost of transferring funds between money and nonmoney accounts, and preferences, especially preferences concerning risk. Equilibrium in the market for money is achieved at the interest rate at which the quantity of money demanded equals the quantity of money supplied. We assumed that the supply of money is determined by the Fed. An increase in money demand raises the equilibrium interest rate, and a decrease in money demand lowers the equilibrium interest rate. An increase in the money supply lowers the equilibrium interest rate; a reduction in the money supply raises the equilibrium interest rate.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="rittenmacro-ch10_s03_l01">
            <li>What factors might increase the demand for bonds? The supply?</li>
            <li>What would happen to the market for bonds if a law were passed that set a minimum price on bonds that was above the equilibrium price?</li>
            <li>When the price of bonds decreases, the interest rate rises. Explain.</li>
            <li>One journalist writing about the complex interactions between various markets in the economy stated: “When the government spends more than it takes in taxes it must sell bonds to finance its excess expenditures. But selling bonds drives interest rates down and thus stimulates the economy by encouraging more investment and decreasing the foreign exchange rate, which helps our export industries.” Carefully analyze the statement. Do you agree? Why or why not?</li>
            <li>What do you predict will happen to the foreign exchange rate if interest rates in the United States increase dramatically over the next year? Explain, using a graph of the foreign exchange market. How would such a change affect real GDP and the price level?</li>
            <li>Suppose the government were to increase its purchases, issuing bonds to finance these purchases. Use your knowledge of the bond and foreign exchange markets to explain how this would affect investment and net exports.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">How would each of the following affect the demand for money?</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist" id="rittenmacro-ch10_s03_l02" numeration="loweralpha">
                    <li>A tax on bonds held by individuals</li>
                    <li>A forecast by the Fed that interest rates will rise sharply in the next quarter</li>
                    <li>A wave of muggings</li>
                    <li>An announcement of an agreement between Congress and the president that, beginning in the next fiscal year, government spending will be reduced by an amount sufficient to eliminate all future borrowing</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Some low-income countries do not have a bond market. In such countries, what substitutes for money do you think people would hold?</li>
            <li>Explain what is meant by the statement that people are holding more money than they want to hold.</li>
            <li>Explain how the Fed’s sale of government bonds shifts the supply curve for money.</li>
            <li>Trace the impact of a sale of government bonds by the Fed on bond prices, interest rates, investment, net exports, aggregate demand, real GDP, and the price level.</li>

            <li>We know that the U.S. economy faced a recessionary gap in 2008 and that the Fed responded with an expansionary monetary policy. Present the results of the Fed’s action in a four-panel graph. In Panel (a), show the initial situation, using the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. In Panel (b), show how the Fed’s policy affects the bond market and bond prices. In Panel (c), show how the market for U.S. dollars and the exchange rate will be affected. In Panel (d), incorporate these developments into your analysis of aggregate demand and aggregate supply, and show how the Fed’s policy will affect real GDP and the price level in the short run.</li>
