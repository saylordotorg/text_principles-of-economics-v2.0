    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_p01">An economy produces a mind-boggling array of goods and services every year. For example, Domino’s Pizza produces hundreds of millions of pizzas. The United States Steel Corporation, the nation’s largest steel company, produces tens of millions of tons of steel. A small logging company in Colorado produces a couple million board feet of lumber. A university football team draws more than half a million fans to its home games. A pediatric nurse in Los Angeles delivers hundreds of babies and takes care of several hundred additional patients. A list of all the goods and services an economy produces in any year would be virtually endless.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_p02">So—what kind of year is the year we are looking at? We would not get very far trying to wade through a list of all the goods and services produced that year. It is helpful to have instead a single number that measures total output in the economy; that number is GDP.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_p02">We will examine each of these components, and we will see how each fits into the pattern of macroeconomic activity. Before we begin, it will be helpful to distinguish between two types of variables: stocks and flows. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">flow variable</a><span class="glossdef">A variable that is measured over a specific period of time.</span></span> is a variable that is measured over a specific period of time. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stock variable</a><span class="glossdef">A variable that is independent of time.</span></span> is a variable that is independent of time. Income is an example of a flow variable. To say one’s income is, for example, $1,000 is meaningless without a time dimension. Is it $1,000 per hour? Per day? Per week? Per month? Until we know the time period, we have no idea what the income figure means. The balance in a checking account is an example of a stock variable. When we learn that the balance in a checking account is $1,000, we know precisely what that means; we do not need a time dimension. We will see that stock and flow variables play very different roles in macroeconomic analysis.</p>
        <div class="section" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Personal Consumption</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Personal consumption</a><span class="glossdef">A flow variable that measures the value of goods and services purchased by households during a time period.</span></span> is a flow variable that measures the value of goods and services purchased by households during a time period. Purchases by households of groceries, health-care services, clothing, and automobiles—all are counted as consumption.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s01_p02">The production of consumer goods and services accounts for about 70% of total output. Because consumption is such a large part of GDP, economists seeking to understand the determinants of GDP must pay special attention to the determinants of consumption. In a later chapter we will explore these determinants and the impact of consumption on economic activity.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s01_p03">Personal consumption represents a demand for goods and services placed on firms by households. In the chapter on demand and supply, we saw how this demand could be presented in a circular flow model of the economy. <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.1 "Personal Consumption in the Circular Flow"</a> presents a circular flow model for an economy that produces only personal consumption goods and services. (We will add the other components of GDP to the circular flow as we discuss them.) Spending for these goods flows from households to firms; it is the arrow labeled “Personal consumption.” Firms produce these goods and services using factors of production: labor, capital, and natural resources. These factors are ultimately owned by households. The production of goods and services thus generates income to households; we see this income as the flow from firms to households labeled “Factor incomes” in the exhibit.</p>

                <p class="para">Personal consumption spending flows from households to firms. In return, consumer goods and services flow from firms to households. To produce the goods and services households demand, firms employ factors of production owned by households. There is thus a flow of factor services from households to firms, and a flow of payments of factor incomes from firms to households.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s01_p04">In exchange for payments that flow from households to firms, there is a flow of consumer goods and services from firms to households. This flow is shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.1 "Personal Consumption in the Circular Flow"</a> as an arrow going from firms to households. When you buy a soda, for example, your payment to the store is part of the flow of personal consumption; the soda is part of the flow of consumer goods and services that goes from the store to a household—yours.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s01_p05">Similarly, the lower arrow in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.1 "Personal Consumption in the Circular Flow"</a> shows the flow of factors of production—labor, capital, and natural resources—from households to firms. If you work for a firm, your labor is part of this flow. The wages you receive are part of the factor incomes that flow from firms to households.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s01_p06">There is a key difference in our interpretation of the circular flow picture in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 21.1 "Personal Consumption in the Circular Flow"</a> from our analysis of the same model in the demand and supply chapter. There, our focus was microeconomics, which examines individual units of the economy. In thinking about the flow of consumption spending from households to firms, we emphasized demand and supply in particular markets—markets for such things as blue jeans, haircuts, and apartments. In thinking about the flow of income payments from firms to households, we focused on the demand and supply for particular factors of production, such as textile workers, barbers, and apartment buildings. Because our focus now is macroeconomics, the study of aggregates of economic activity, we will think in terms of the <em class="emphasis">total</em> of personal consumption and the <em class="emphasis">total</em> of payments to households.</p>

Like personal consumption, gross private domestic investment is a flow variable. It is often simply referred to as “private investment.” A hammer produced for a carpenter is private investment. A printing press produced for a magazine publisher is private investment, as is a conveyor-belt system produced for a manufacturing firm. Capital includes all the goods that have been produced for use in producing other goods; it is a stock variable. Private investment is a flow variable that adds to the stock of capital during a period.</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s02_p02">The term “<em class="emphasis">investment</em>” can generate confusion. In everyday conversation, we use the term “<em class="emphasis">investment</em>” to refer to uses of money to earn income. We say we have invested in a stock or invested in a bond. Economists, however, restrict “<em class="emphasis">investment</em>” to activities that increase the economy’s stock of capital. The purchase of a share of stock does not add to the capital stock; it is not investment in the economic meaning of the word. We refer to the exchange of financial assets, such as stocks or bonds, as financial investment to distinguish it from the creation of capital that occurs as the result of investment. Only when new capital is produced does investment occur. Confusing the economic concept of private investment with the concept of financial investment can cause misunderstanding of the way in which key components of the economy relate to one another.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s02_p03">Gross private domestic investment includes three flows that add to or maintain the nation’s capital stock: expenditures by business firms on new buildings, plants, tools, equipment, and software that will be used in the production of goods and services; expenditures on new residential housing; and changes in business inventories. Any addition to a firm’s inventories represents an addition to investment; a reduction subtracts from investment. For example, if a clothing store stocks 1,000 pairs of jeans, the jeans represent an addition to inventory and are part of gross private domestic investment. As the jeans are sold, they are subtracted from inventory and thus subtracted from investment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s02_p04">By recording additions to inventories as investment and reductions from inventories as subtractions from investment, the accounting for GDP records production in the period in which it occurs. Suppose, for example, that Levi Strauss manufactures 1 million pairs of jeans late in 2011 and distributes them to stores at the end of December. The jeans will be added to inventory; they thus count as investment in 2011 and enter GDP for that year. Suppose they are sold in January 2012. They will be counted as consumption in GDP for 2012 but subtracted from inventory, and from investment. Thus, the production of the jeans will add to GDP in 2011, when they were produced. They will not count in 2012, save for any increase in the value of the jeans resulting from the services provided by the retail stores that sold them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s02_p05">Private investment accounts for about 15% of GDP—but, at times, even less. Despite its relatively small share of total economic activity, private investment plays a crucial role in the macroeconomy for two reasons:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>Private investment represents a choice to forgo current consumption in order to add to the capital stock of the economy. Private investment therefore adds to the economy’s capacity to produce and shifts its production possibilities curve outward. Investment is thus one determinant of economic growth, which is explored in another chapter.</li>
                <li>Private investment is a relatively volatile component of GDP; it can change dramatically from one year to the next. Fluctuations in GDP are often driven by fluctuations in private investment. We will examine the determinants of private investment in a chapter devoted to the study of investment.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s02_p06">Private investment represents a demand placed on firms for the production of capital goods. While it is a demand placed on firms, it flows from firms.

In the same year, U.S. residents, firms, and government agencies purchased $2,664.4 billion worth of goods and services from foreign countries. The difference between these two figures, −$576.9 billion, represented the net exports of the U.S. economy in 2011. Net exports were negative because imports exceeded exports. Negative net exports constitute a <span class="margin_term" id="mtm_10"><a class="glossterm">trade deficit</a><span class="glossdef">Negative net exports.</span></span>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s01_s04_p03">The United States has recorded more deficits than surpluses since World War II, but the amounts have typically been relatively small, only a few billion dollars. The trade deficit began to soar, however, in the 1980s and again in the 2000s. We will examine the reasons for persistent trade deficits in another chapter. The rest of the world plays a key role in the domestic economy and, as we will see later in the book, there is nothing particularly good or bad about trade surpluses or deficits. Goods and services produced for export represent roughly 14% of GDP, and the goods and services the United States imports add significantly to our standard of living.</p>

For example, an increase in any of the flows that place demands on firms (personal consumption, private investment, government purchases, and exports) will induce firms to expand their production. This effect is characteristic of the expansion phase of the business cycle. An increase in production will require firms to employ more factors of production, which will create more income for households. Households are likely to respond with more consumption, which will induce still more production, more income, and still more consumption. Similarly, a reduction in any of the demands placed on firms will lead to a reduction in output, a reduction in firms’ use of factors of production, a reduction in household incomes, a reduction in income, and so on. This sequence of events is characteristic of the contraction phase of the business cycle. Much of our work in macroeconomics will involve an analysis of the forces that prompt such changes in demand and an examination of the economy’s response to them.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s02_p02">Suppose, for example, that a logger cuts some trees and sells the logs to a sawmill. The mill makes lumber and sells it to a construction firm, which builds a house. The market price for the lumber includes the value of the logs; the price of the house includes the value of the lumber. If we try to estimate GDP by adding the value of the logs, the lumber, and the house, we would be counting the lumber twice and the logs three times. This problem is called “double counting,” and the economists who compute GDP seek to avoid it.</p>

The construction firm uses the lumber to build a house, which it sells to a household for $125,000. (To simplify the example, we will ignore inputs other than lumber that are used to build the house.) The value of the final product, the house, is $125,000. The value added at each stage of production is estimated as follows:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s03_p01">While GDP represents the most commonly used measure of an economy’s output, economists sometimes use an alternative measure. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Gross national product (GNP)</a><span class="glossdef">The total value of final goods and services produced during a particular period with factors of production owned by the residents of a particular country.</span></span> is the total value of final goods and services produced during a particular period with factors of production owned by the residents of a particular country.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s03_p02">The difference between GDP and GNP is a subtle one. The GDP of a country equals the value of final output produced within the borders of that country; the GNP of a country equals the value of final output produced using factors owned by residents of the country. Most production in a country employs factors of production owned by residents of that country, so the two measures overlap. Differences between the two measures emerge when production in one country employs factors of production <em class="emphasis">owned</em> by residents of other countries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s03_p03">Suppose, for example, that a resident of Bellingham, Washington, owns and operates a watch repair shop across the Canadian–U.S. border in Victoria, British Columbia. The value of watch repair services produced at the shop would be counted as part of Canada’s GDP because they are produced in Canada. That value would not, however, be part of U.S. GDP. But, because the watch repair services were produced using capital and labor provided by a resident of the United States, they would be counted as part of GNP in the United States and not as part of GNP in Canada.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s03_p04">Because most production fits in both a country’s GDP as well as its GNP, there is seldom much difference between the two measures. The relationship between GDP and GNP is given by</p>

                <li>GDP is the sum of final goods and services produced for consumption (<em class="emphasis">C</em>), private investment (<em class="emphasis">I</em>), government purchases (<em class="emphasis">G</em>), and net exports (<em class="emphasis">X</em><sub class="subscript">n</sub>). Thus GDP = <em class="emphasis">C</em> + <em class="emphasis">I</em> + <em class="emphasis">G</em> + <em class="emphasis">X</em><sub class="subscript">n</sub>.</li>
                <li>GDP can be viewed in the context of the circular flow model. Consumption goods and services are produced in response to demands from households; investment goods are produced in response to demands for new capital by firms; government purchases include goods and services purchased by government agencies; and net exports equal exports less imports.</li>
                <li>Total output can be measured two ways: as the sum of the values of final goods and services produced and as the sum of values added at each stage of production.</li>
                <li>GDP plus net income received from other countries equals GNP. GNP is the measure of output typically used to compare incomes generated by different economies.</li>

            <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s03_p08">Outside the United States, the value added tax (VAT) has become commonplace. Governments of more than 120 countries use it as their primary means of raising revenue. While the concept of the VAT originated in France in the 1920s, no country adopted it until after World War II. In 1948, France became the first country in the world to use the VAT. In 1967, Brazil became the first country in the Western Hemisphere to do so. The VAT spread to other western European and Latin American countries in the 1970s and 1980s and then to countries in the Asia/Pacific region, central European and former Soviet Union area, and Africa in the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s03_p09">What is the VAT? It is equivalent to a sales tax on final goods and services but is collected at each stage of production.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s03_p10">Take the example given in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s02_t01">Table 21.1 "Final Value and Value Added"</a>, which is a simplified illustration of a house built in three stages. If there were a sales tax of 10% on the house, the household buying it would pay $137,500, of which the construction firm would keep $125,000 of the total and turn $12,500 over to the government.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s03_p11">With a 10% VAT, the sawmill would pay the logger $13,200, of which the logger would keep $12,000 and turn $1,200 over to the government. The sawmill would sell the lumber to the construction firm for $27,500—keeping $26,200, which is the $25,000 for the lumber itself and $1,200 it already paid in tax. The government at this stage would get $1,300, the difference between the $2,500 the construction firm collected as tax and the $1,200 the sawmill already paid in tax to the logger at the previous stage. The household would pay the construction firm $137,500. Of that total, the construction firm would turn over to the government $10,000, which is the difference between the $12,500 it collected for the government in tax from the household and the $2,500 in tax that it already paid when it bought the lumber from the sawmill. The table below shows that in the end, the tax revenue generated by a 10% VAT is the same as that generated by a 10% tax on final sales.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s03_p12">Why bother to tax in stages instead of just on final sales? One reason is simply record keeping, since it may be difficult to determine in practice if any particular sale is the final one. In the example, the construction firm does not need to know if it is selling the house to a household or to some intermediary business.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch06_s01_s03_p13">Also, the VAT may lead to higher revenue collected. For example, even if somehow the household buying the house avoided paying the tax, the government would still have collected some tax revenue at earlier stages of production. With a tax on retail sales, it would have collected nothing. The VAT has another advantage from the point of view of government agencies. It has the appearance at each stage of taking a smaller share. The individual amounts collected are not as obvious to taxpayers as a sales tax might be.</p>
