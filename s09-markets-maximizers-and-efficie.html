        <h2 class="title editable block">Start Up: A Drive in the Country</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e92.rittenberg-ch06_s00_p01">Suppose you decide to take a drive. For purposes of this example, we will assume that you have a car available, that the weather is pleasant, and that there is an area nearby that will be perfect for your drive.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e93.rittenberg-ch06_s00_p02">Your decision to take this drive is a choice. Since economics deals with choices, we can put economics to work in thinking about it. Economists assume that people make choices that maximize the value of some objective. You are a consumer; we assume that taking a drive is a choice that maximizes your utility—the satisfaction you obtain from your use of goods and services and from the activities you pursue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e94.rittenberg-ch06_s00_p03">You certainly plan to enjoy the drive; that enjoyment is the benefit you expect from it. But you will give up some things as well. Your drive will take some time, time you could have spent doing something else. It will take some gasoline; what you spend for the gasoline could have been used for something else. The drive will also generate some wear and tear on your car. That will cost you the price of repair and maintenance and reduced resale value of your car. The opportunity cost of your drive will thus include the value of the best other use of your time and the value of the best other use of the funds your drive will require. To maximize utility you will weigh the benefits of the drive against the cost of the drive and maximize the difference between those benefits and costs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e95.rittenberg-ch06_s00_p04">This chapter introduces the method through which maximizing choices can be made. This method applies not just to your decision to take a drive, but also to Wal-Mart’s decision to hire extra workers and to USX Corporation’s to produce extra steel. The method we will learn can be applied to the analysis of any choice; we will use it throughout our investigation of microeconomics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e96.rittenberg-ch06_s00_p05">We will also see how maximizing choices by individuals and by firms can lead to an allocation of resources that generates the greatest gains possible for the economy as a whole. In this analysis, we will put a new item in our toolkit, the method through which individuals and firms maximize, together with demand and supply analysis, to see how the marketplace can guide resources to their best uses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e97.rittenberg-ch06_s00_p06">We will also examine cases in which maximizing choices do not guide resources to their best uses. That possibility is suggested by another aspect of your choice to take a drive. In addition to the costs you will consider, there will be costs imposed on others. Your drive will pollute the air, so part of the opportunity cost of the drive will be the value of the slightly cleaner air people in your area might have had. Resources such as the air we breathe will almost certainly be misallocated as the result of maximizing choices. We will see just how misallocation of an economy’s resources can occur and how this misallocation could be fixed.</p>

            <li>Explain the maximization assumption that economists make in explaining the behavior of consumers and firms.</li>
            <li>Explain and illustrate the concepts of marginal benefit and marginal cost and apply them to understanding the marginal decision rule.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_p01">To say that individuals maximize is to say that they pick some objective and then seek to maximize its value. A sprinter might want to maximize his or her speed; a politician might want to maximize the probability that he or she will win the next election. Economists pay special attention to two groups of maximizers: consumers and firms. We assume that consumers seek to maximize utility and that firms seek to maximize <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">economic profit</a><span class="glossdef">The difference between total revenue and total cost.</span></span>, which is the difference between total revenue and total cost. The costs involved in this concept of economic profit are computed in the economic sense—as the opportunity costs, or value of the best opportunity forgone.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_p02">The assumption of maximizing behavior lies at the heart of economic analysis. As we explore its implications, however, we must keep in mind the distinction between models and the real world. Our model assumes that individuals make choices in a way that achieves a maximum value for some clearly defined objective. In using such a model, economists do not assume that people actually go through the calculations we will describe. What economists do argue is that people’s behavior is broadly consistent with such a model. People may not consciously seek to maximize anything, but they behave as though they do.</p>
    <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Analysis of Maximizing Behavior</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_p01">The activities of consumers and firms have benefits, and they also have opportunity costs. We assume that given these benefits and costs, consumers and firms will make choices that maximize the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">net benefit</a><span class="glossdef">The total benefit of an activity minus its opportunity cost.</span></span> of each activity—the total benefit of the activity minus its opportunity cost. The specific measures of benefit and cost vary with the kind of choice being made. In the case of a firm’s choices in production, for example, the total benefit of production is the revenue a firm receives from selling the product; the total cost is the opportunity cost the firm incurs by producing it. The net benefit is thus total revenue minus total opportunity cost, or economic profit.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_p02">Economists maintain that in order to maximize net benefit, consumers and firms evaluate each activity at the margin—they consider the additional benefit and the additional cost of another unit of the activity. Should you “supersize” your order at McDonald’s? Will the additional beverage and the additional french fries be worth the extra cost? Should a firm hire one more worker? Will the benefits to the firm of hiring this worker be worth the additional cost of hiring him or her?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_p03">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marginal benefit</a><span class="glossdef">The amount by which an additional unit of an activity increases its total benefit.</span></span> is the amount by which an additional unit of an activity increases its total benefit. It is the amount by which the extra french fries increase your satisfaction, or the extra revenue the firm expects to bring in by hiring another worker. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marginal cost</a><span class="glossdef">The amount by which an additional unit of an activity increases its total cost.</span></span> is the amount by which an additional unit of an activity increases its total cost. You will pay more to supersize your McDonald’s order; the firm’s labor costs will rise when it hires another worker.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_p04">To determine the quantity of any activity that will maximize its net benefit, we apply the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marginal decision rule</a><span class="glossdef">If the marginal benefit of an additional unit of an activity exceeds the marginal cost, the quantity of the activity should be increased. If the marginal benefit is less than the marginal cost, the quantity should be reduced.</span></span>: If the marginal benefit of an additional unit of an activity exceeds the marginal cost, the quantity of the activity should be increased. If the marginal benefit is less than the marginal cost, the quantity should be reduced. Net benefit is maximized at the point at which marginal benefit equals marginal cost. The marginal decision rule is at the heart of the economic way of thinking. The rule basically says this: If the additional benefit of one more unit exceeds the extra cost, do it; if not, do not. This simple logic gives us a powerful tool for the analysis of choice. Perhaps more than any other rule in economic analysis, the marginal decision rule typifies the way in which economists analyze problems. We shall apply it in every chapter that follows in the microeconomics portion of this text.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_p05">Maximizing choices must be made within the parameters imposed by some <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">constraint</a><span class="glossdef">A boundary that limits the range of choices that can be made.</span></span>, which is a boundary that limits the range of choices that can be made. We assume that a consumer seeks the greatest satisfaction possible within the limits of his or her income or budget. A firm cannot produce beyond the limits of its production capacity at a point in time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_p06">The marginal decision rule forms the foundation for the structure economists use to analyze all choices. At first glance, it may seem that a consumer seeking satisfaction from, say, pizza has little in common with an entrepreneur seeking profit from the production of custom-designed semiconductors. But maximizing choices always follow the marginal decision rule—and that rule holds regardless of what is being maximized or who is doing the maximizing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_p07">To see how the logic of maximizing choices works, we will examine a specific problem. We will then extend that problem to the general analysis of maximizing choices.</p>
        <div class="section" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">A Problem in Maximization</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p01">Suppose a college student, Laurie Phan, faces two midterms tomorrow, one in economics and another in accounting. She has already decided to spend 5 hours studying for the two examinations. This decision imposes a constraint on the problem. Suppose that Ms. Phan’s goal is to allocate her 5 hours of study so that she increases her total score for the two exams by as much as possible.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p02">Ms. Phan expects the relationship between the time she spends studying for the economics exam and the total gain in her score to be as given by the second row of the table in Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_f01">Figure 6.1 "The Benefits of Studying Economics"</a>. We interpret the expected total gain in her score as the total benefit of study. She expects that 1 hour of study will raise her score by 18 points; 2 hours will raise it by 32 points, and so on. These values are plotted in Panel (b). Notice that the total benefit curve rises, but by smaller and smaller amounts, as she studies more and more. The slope of the curve, which in this case tells us the rate at which her expected score rises with increased study time, falls as we travel up and to the right along the curve.</p>
            <div class="figure large editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_f01">
                <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 6.1</span> The Benefits of Studying Economics</p>
                <img src="section_09/a11b4483de920b6b47c666f98d280850.jpg">
                <p class="para">The table in Panel (a) shows the total benefit and marginal benefit of the time Laurie Phan spends studying for her economics exam. Panel (b) shows the total benefit curve. Panel (c) shows the marginal benefit curve, which is given by the slope of the total benefit curve in Panel (b).</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p03">Now look at the third row in the table in Panel (a). It tells us the amount by which each additional hour of study increases her expected score; it gives the marginal benefit of studying for the economics exam. Marginal benefit equals the amount by which total benefit rises with each additional hour of study. Because these marginal benefits are given by the changes in total benefits from additional hours of study, they equal the slope of the total benefit curve. We see this in the relationship between Panels (b) and (c) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_f01">Figure 6.1 "The Benefits of Studying Economics"</a>. The decreasing slope of the total benefit curve in Panel (b) gives us the downward-sloping marginal benefit curve in Panel (c).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p04">The marginal benefit curve tells us what happens when we pass from one point to another on the total benefit curve, so we have plotted marginal benefits at the midpoints of the hourly intervals in Panel (c). For example, the total benefit curve in Panel (b) tells us that, when Ms. Phan increases her time studying for the economics exam from 2 hours to 3 hours, her total benefit rises from 32 points to 42 points. The increase of 10 points is the marginal benefit of increasing study time for the economics exam from 2 hours to 3 hours. We mark the point for a marginal benefit of 10 points midway between 2 and 3 hours. Because marginal values tell us what happens as we pass from one quantity to the next, we shall always plot them at the midpoints of intervals of the variable on the horizontal axis.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p05">We can perform the same kind of analysis to obtain the marginal benefit curve for studying for the accounting exam. <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 6.2 "The Marginal Benefits of Studying Accounting"</a> presents this curve. Like the marginal benefit curve for studying economics, it slopes downward. Once again, we have plotted marginal values at the midpoints of the intervals. Increasing study time in accounting from 0 to 1 hour increases Ms. Phan’s expected accounting score by 14 points.</p>
            <div class="figure medium editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_f02">
                <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 6.2</span> The Marginal Benefits of Studying Accounting</p>
                <img src="section_09/4fce12403ff41268ce7e9156039cf7af.jpg">
                <p class="para">The marginal benefit Laurie Phan expects from studying for her accounting exam is shown by the marginal benefit curve. The first hour of study increases her expected score by 14 points, the second hour by 10 points, the third by 6 points, and so on.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p06">Ms. Phan’s marginal benefit curves for studying typify a general phenomenon in economics. Marginal benefit curves for virtually all activities, including the activities of consumers and of firms, slope downward. Think about your own experience with studying. On a given day, the first hour spent studying a certain subject probably generates a greater marginal benefit than the second, and the second hour probably generates a greater marginal benefit than the third. You may reach a point at which an extra hour of study is unlikely to yield any benefit at all. Of course, our example of Laurie Phan’s expected exam scores is a highly stylized one. One could hardly expect a student to have a precise set of numbers to guide him or her in allocating study time. But it is certainly the case that students have a rough idea of the likely payoff of study time in different subjects. If you were faced with exams in two subjects, it is likely that you would set aside a certain amount of study time, just as Ms. Phan did in our example. And it is likely that your own experience would serve as a guide in determining how to allocate that time. Economists do not assume that people have numerical scales in their heads with which to draw marginal benefit and marginal cost curves. They merely assume that people act as if they did.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p07">The nature of marginal benefits can change with different applications. For a restaurant, the marginal benefit of serving one more meal can be defined as the revenue that meal produces. For a consumer, the marginal benefit of one more slice of pizza can be considered in terms of the additional satisfaction the pizza will create. But whatever the nature of the benefit, marginal benefits generally fall as quantities increase.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p08">Ms. Phan’s falling marginal benefit from hours spent studying accounting has special significance for our analysis of her choice concerning how many hours to devote to economics. In our problem, she had decided to devote 5 hours to studying the two subjects. That means that the opportunity cost of an hour spent studying economics equals the benefit she would have gotten spending that hour studying accounting.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p09">Suppose, for example, that she were to consider spending all 5 hours studying accounting. The marginal benefit curve for studying for her accounting exam tells us that she expects that the fifth hour will add nothing to her score. Shifting that hour to economics would cost nothing. We can say that the marginal cost of the first hour spent studying economics is zero. We obtained this value from the marginal benefit curve for studying accounting in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 6.2 "The Marginal Benefits of Studying Accounting"</a>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p10">Similarly, we can find the marginal cost of the second hour studying economics. That requires giving up the fourth hour spent on accounting. <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 6.2 "The Marginal Benefits of Studying Accounting"</a> tells us that the marginal benefit of that hour equals 2—that is the marginal cost of spending the second hour studying economics.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p11"><a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_f03">Figure 6.3 "The Marginal Benefits and Marginal Costs of Studying Economics"</a> shows the marginal cost curve of studying economics. We see that at first, time devoted to studying economics has a low marginal cost. As time spent studying economics increases, however, it requires her to give up study time in accounting that she expects will be more and more productive. The marginal cost curve for studying economics can thus be derived from the marginal benefit curve for studying accounting. <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_f03">Figure 6.3 "The Marginal Benefits and Marginal Costs of Studying Economics"</a> also shows the marginal benefit curve for studying economics that we derived in Panel (b) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_f01">Figure 6.1 "The Benefits of Studying Economics"</a>.</p>

The marginal cost curve is derived from the marginal benefit curve for studying accounting shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 6.2 "The Marginal Benefits of Studying Accounting"</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p12">Just as marginal benefit curves generally slope downward, marginal cost curves generally slope upward, as does the one in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_f03">Figure 6.3 "The Marginal Benefits and Marginal Costs of Studying Economics"</a>. In the case of allocating time, the phenomenon of rising marginal cost results from the simple fact that, the more time a person devotes to one activity, the less time is available for another. And the more one reduces the second activity, the greater the forgone marginal benefits are likely to be. That means the marginal cost curve for that first activity rises.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p13">Because we now have marginal benefit and marginal cost curves for studying economics, we can apply the marginal decision rule. This rule says that, to maximize the net benefit of an activity, a decision maker should increase an activity up to the point at which marginal benefit equals marginal cost. That occurs where the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves intersect, with 3 hours spent studying economics and 2 hours spent studying accounting.</p>

First, note that the sum of the areas of the five rectangles, 50 points, equals the total benefit of 5 hours of study given in the table in Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s01_f01">Figure 6.1 "The Benefits of Studying Economics"</a>. Second, notice that the shaded areas are approximately equal to the area under the marginal benefit curve between 0 and 5 hours of study.

The marginal cost of the second hour of study equals 2 points; that is the area of the rectangle bounded by 1 and 2 hours of study and a marginal cost of 2. The marginal cost of the third hour of study is 6 points; this is the area of the shaded rectangle bounded by 2 and 3 hours of study and a marginal cost of 6.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p05">Looking at the rectangles in Panel (b) over the range of 0 to 5 hours of study, we see that the areas of the five rectangles total 32, the total cost of spending all 5 hours studying economics. And looking at the rectangles, we see that their area is approximately equal to the area under the marginal cost curve between 0 and 5 hours of study.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p06">We have seen that the areas of the rectangles drawn with Laurie Phan’s marginal benefit and marginal cost curves equal the total benefit and total cost of studying economics. We have also seen that these areas are roughly equal to the areas under the curves themselves. We can make this last statement much stronger. Suppose, instead of thinking in intervals of whole hours, we think in terms of smaller intervals, say, of 12 minutes. Then each rectangle would be only one-fifth as wide as the rectangles we drew in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_f01">Figure 6.4 "The Benefits and Costs of Studying Economics"</a>. Their areas would still equal the total benefit and total cost of study, and the sum of those areas would be closer to the area under the curves. We have done this for Ms. Phan’s marginal benefit curve in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_f02">Figure 6.5 "The Marginal Benefit Curve and Total Benefit"</a>; notice that the areas of the rectangles closely approximate the area under the curve. They still “stick out” from either side of the curve as did the rectangles we drew in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_f01">Figure 6.4 "The Benefits and Costs of Studying Economics"</a>, but you almost need a magnifying glass to see that. The smaller the interval we choose, the closer the areas under the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves will be to total benefit and total cost. For purposes of our model, we can imagine that the intervals are as small as we like. Over a particular range of quantity, the area under a marginal benefit curve equals the total benefit of that quantity, and the area under the marginal cost curve equals the total cost of that quantity.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p07">Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_f03">Figure 6.6 "Using Marginal Benefit and Marginal Cost Curves to Determine Net Benefit"</a> shows marginal benefit and marginal cost curves for studying economics, this time without numbers. We have the usual downward-sloping marginal benefit curve and upward-sloping marginal cost curve. The marginal decision rule tells us to choose D hours studying economics, the quantity at which marginal benefit equals marginal cost at point C. We know that the total benefit of study equals the area under the marginal benefit curve over the range from A to D hours of study, the area ABCD. Total cost equals the area under the marginal cost curve over the same range, or ACD. The difference between total benefit and total cost equals the area between marginal benefit and marginal cost between A and D hours of study; it is the green-shaded triangle ABC. This difference is the net benefit of time spent studying economics. Panel (b) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_f03">Figure 6.6 "Using Marginal Benefit and Marginal Cost Curves to Determine Net Benefit"</a> introduces another important concept. If an activity is carried out at a level less than the efficient level, then net benefits are forgone. The loss in net benefits resulting from a failure to carry out an activity at the efficient level is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">deadweight loss</a><span class="glossdef">The loss in net benefits resulting from a failure to carry out an activity at the most efficient level.</span></span>.</p>

                <p class="para">In Panel (a) net benefits are given by the difference between total benefits (as measured by the area under the marginal benefit curve up to any given level of activity) and total costs (as measured by the area under the marginal cost curve up to any given level of activity). Maximum net benefits are found where the marginal benefit curve intersects the marginal cost curve at activity level D. Panel (b) shows that if the level of the activity is restricted to activity level E, net benefits are reduced from the light-green shaded triangle ABC in Panel (a) to the smaller area ABGF. The forgone net benefits, or deadweight loss, is given by the purple-shaded area FGC. If the activity level is increased from D to J, as shown in Panel (c), net benefits declined by the deadweight loss measured by the area CHI.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p08">Now suppose a person increases study time from D to J hours as shown in Panel (c). The area under the marginal cost curve between D and J gives the total cost of increasing study time; it is DCHJ. The total benefit of increasing study time equals the area under the marginal benefit curve between D and J; it is DCIJ. The cost of increasing study time in economics from D hours to J hours exceeds the benefit. This gives us a deadweight loss of CHI. The net benefit of spending J hours studying economics equals the net benefit of studying for D hours less the deadweight loss, or ABC <em class="emphasis">minus</em> CHI. Only by studying up to the point at which marginal benefit equals marginal cost do we achieve the maximum net benefit shown in Panel (a).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p09">We can apply the marginal decision rule to the problem in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_f03">Figure 6.6 "Using Marginal Benefit and Marginal Cost Curves to Determine Net Benefit"</a> in another way. In Panel (b), a person studies economics for E hours. Reading up to the marginal benefit curve, we reach point G. Reading up to the marginal cost curve, we reach point F. Marginal benefit at G exceeds marginal cost at F; the marginal decision rule says economics study should be increased, which would take us toward the intersection of the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves. Spending J hours studying economics, as shown in Panel (c), is too much. Reading up to the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves, we see that marginal cost exceeds marginal benefit, suggesting that study time be reduced.</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p21">Do we spill enough oil in our oceans and waterways? It is a question that perhaps only economists would ask—and, as economists, we should ask it.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p22">There is, of course, no virtue in an oil spill. It destroys wildlife and fouls shorelines. Cleanup costs can be tremendous. However, preventing oil spills has costs as well: greater enforcement expenditures and higher costs to shippers of oil and, therefore, higher costs of goods such as gasoline to customers. The only way to prevent oil spills completely is to stop drilling for and shipping oil. That is a cost few people would accept. But what is the right balance between environmental protection and the satisfaction of consumer demand for oil?</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p23">Vanderbilt University economist Mark Cohen examined the U.S. Coast Guard’s efforts to reduce oil spills when transporting oil through its enforcement of shipping regulations in coastal waters and on rivers. He focused on the costs and benefits resulting from the Coast Guard’s enforcement efforts in 1981. On the basis of the frequency of oil spills before the Coast Guard began its enforcement, Mr. Cohen estimated that the Coast Guard prevented 1,159,352 gallons of oil from being spilled in 1981.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p24">Given that there was a total of 824,921 gallons of oil actually spilled in 1981, should the Coast Guard have attempted to prevent even more spillage? Mr. Cohen estimated that the marginal benefit of preventing one more gallon from being spilled was $7.27 ($3.42 in cleanup costs, $3 less in environmental damage, and $0.85 worth of oil saved). The marginal cost of preventing one more gallon from being spilled was $5.50. Mr. Cohen suggests that because the marginal benefit of more vigorous enforcement exceeded the marginal cost, more vigorous Coast Guard efforts would have been justified.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p25">More vigorous efforts have, indeed, been pursued. In 1989, the Exxon oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground, spilling 10.8 million gallons of oil off the coast of Alaska. The spill damaged the shoreline of a national forest, four national wildlife refuges, three national parks, five state parks, four critical habitat areas, and a state game refuge. Exxon was ordered to pay $900 million in damages; a federal jury found Exxon and the captain guilty of criminal negligence and imposed an additional $5 billion in punitive damages. In 2008, The Supreme Court reduced the assessment of punitive damages to $507 million, with the majority arguing that the original figure was too high in comparison to the compensatory damages for a case in which the actions of the defendant, Exxon, were “reprehensible” but not intentional.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p26">Perhaps the most important impact of the Exxon Valdez disaster was the passage of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. It increased shipper liability from $14 million to $100 million. It also required double-hulled tankers for shipping oil.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p27">The European Union (EU) has also strengthened its standards for oil tankers. The 2002 breakup of the oil tanker Prestige off the coast of Spain resulted in the spillage of 3.2 million gallons of oil. The EU had planned to ban single-hulled tankers, phasing in the ban between 2003 and 2015. The sinking of the Prestige led the EU to move up that deadline.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p28">Tanker spill crises have led both the United States and the European Union to tighten up their regulations of oil tankers. The result has been a reduction in the quantity of oil spilled, which was precisely what economic research had concluded was needed. Whereas the total quantity of oil spilled from tankers in the 1970s was over 3 million tons, for the decade of the 2000s the total was 212,000 tons—a decline of over 90%—even as the amount of oil shipped rose dramatically.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p31">The year 2010 saw another kind of major oil spill resulting from offshore drilling. The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, in which 11 workers were killed and 17 injured, led to a spill of 4.1 million barrels into the Gulf over a 3-month period. This spill was about 40% larger than the second largest offshore drilling spill off the U.S. coast and 19 times bigger than the Exxon Valdez spill. So far, no major legislation affecting oil drilling has passed, though, after a five-month drilling moratorium, the U.S. Department of the Interior has made changes to its enforcement practices. </p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p32">Whether or not new legislation concerning offshore oil drilling is needed and how it should be constructed is being hotly debated. A preliminary study by Alan Krupnick, Sarah Campbell, Mark A. Cohen, and Ian W. H. Parry for the organization Resources for the Future estimated the annual benefits of preventing a catastrophic spill to be between $16.1 billion and $29.5 billion. The annual costs of a ban they estimate to be about $65 billion, from which they conclude that cost-benefit analysis does not justify a ban. On the other hand, they argue that regulation that would increase the costs of extraction by 10% or $11 billion annually would pass a cost-benefit analysis test and that regulation that raises extraction cost by 20% or $22 billion would pass the test at the upper end of the benefits estimate only. It should be noted that the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 was passed about a year and a half after the Exxon Valdez incident.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_p01">In perhaps the most influential book in economics ever written, <em class="emphasis">An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</em>, published in 1776, Adam Smith argued that the pursuit of self-interest in a marketplace would promote the general interest. He said resources would be guided, as if by an “invisible hand,” to their best uses. That invisible hand was the marketplace.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_p02">Smith’s idea was radical for its time; he saw that the seemingly haphazard workings of the marketplace could promote the common good. In this section, we will use the tools we have developed thus far to see the power of Smith’s invisible hand. Efforts by individuals to maximize their own net benefit can maximize net benefit for the economy as a whole.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_p03">When the net benefits of all economic activities are maximized, economists say the allocation of resources is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">efficient</a><span class="glossdef">The allocation of resources when the net benefits of all economic activities are maximized.</span></span>. This concept of efficiency is broader than the notion of efficient production that we encountered when discussing the production possibilities curve. There, we saw that the economy’s factors of production would be efficient <em class="emphasis">in production</em> if they were allocated according to the principle of comparative advantage. That meant producing as much as possible with the factors of production available. The concept of an efficient allocation of resources incorporates production, as in that discussion, but it includes efficiency in the consumption of goods and services as well.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Achieving Efficiency</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s01_p01">Imagine yourself arriving at the store to purchase some food. In your choice, you will weigh your own benefits and costs to maximize your net benefit. The farmers, the distributors, and the grocer have sought to maximize their net benefits as well. How can we expect that all those efforts will maximize net benefits for the economy as a whole? How can we expect the marketplace to achieve an efficient allocation of food, or of anything else?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s01_p02">One condition that must be met if the market’s allocation is to be efficient is that the marketplace must be competitive or function as if it were. We will have a great deal more to say about competitive markets versus less competitive ones in subsequent chapters. For now, we can simply note that a competitive market is one with many buyers and sellers in each market and in which entry and exit are fairly easy. No one controls the price; the forces of demand and supply determine price.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s01_p03">The second condition that must hold if the market is to achieve an efficient allocation concerns property rights. We turn to that topic in the next section.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s01_s01_p01">A smoothly functioning market requires that producers possess property rights to the goods and services they produce and that consumers possess property rights to the goods and services they buy. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Property rights</a><span class="glossdef">A set of rules that specify the ways in which an owner can use a resource.</span></span> are a set of rules that specify the ways in which an owner can use a resource.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s01_s01_p02">Consider the tomato market. Farmers who grow tomatoes have clearly defined rights to their land and to the tomatoes they produce and sell. Distributors who purchase tomatoes from farmers and sell them to grocers have clear rights to the tomatoes until they sell them to grocers. The grocers who purchase the tomatoes retain rights to them until they sell them to consumers. When you buy a tomato, you have the exclusive right to its use.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s01_s01_p03">A system of property rights forms the basis for all market exchange. Before exchange can begin, there must be a clear specification of who owns what. The system of property rights must also show what purchasers are acquiring when they buy rights to particular resources. Because property rights must exist if exchange is to occur, and because exchange is the process through which economic efficiency is achieved, a system of property rights is essential to the efficient allocation of resources.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s01_s01_p04">Imagine what would happen in the market for tomatoes if property rights were not clearly defined. Suppose, for example, that grocers could not legally prevent someone from simply grabbing some tomatoes and leaving without paying for them. If that were the case, grocers would not be likely to offer tomatoes for sale. If it were the case for all grocery items, there would not be grocery stores at all.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s01_s01_p05">Although property rights vary for different resources, two characteristics are required if the marketplace is to achieve an efficient allocation of resources:</p>

                <p class="para">In a competitive market with exclusive and transferable property rights, such as the market for tomatoes, the efficiency condition is met. Buyers and sellers are faced with all of the relevant benefits and costs, and the equilibrium price equals the marginal cost to society of producing that good, here $2.50 per pound. We can interpret the market demand and supply curve as marginal benefit and marginal cost curves, respectively.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s01_s02_p03">The demand curve tells us that the last pound of tomatoes was worth $1.50; we can think of that as the marginal benefit of the last pound of tomatoes since that is how much consumers were willing to pay. We can say that about any price on a market demand curve; a demand curve can be considered as a marginal benefit curve. Similarly, the supply curve can be considered the marginal cost curve. In the case of the tomato market, for example, the price tells us that the marginal cost of producing the last pound of tomatoes is $1.50. This marginal cost is considered in the economic sense—other goods and services worth $1.50 were not produced in order to make an additional pound of tomatoes available.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s01_s02_p04">On what basis can we presume that the price of a pound of tomatoes equals its marginal cost? The answer lies in our marginal decision rule. Profit-maximizing tomato producers will produce more tomatoes as long as their marginal benefit exceeds their marginal cost. What is the marginal benefit to a producer of an extra pound of tomatoes? It is the price that the producer will receive. What is the marginal cost? It is the value that must be given up to produce an extra pound of tomatoes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s01_s02_p05">Producers maximize profit by expanding their production up to the point at which their marginal cost equals their marginal benefit, which is the market price. The price of $1.50 thus reflects the marginal cost to society of making an additional pound of tomatoes available.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s01_s02_p06">At the equilibrium price and output of tomatoes, then, the marginal benefit of tomatoes to consumers, as reflected by the price they are willing to pay, equals the marginal cost of producing tomatoes. Where marginal benefit equals marginal cost, net benefit is maximized. The equilibrium quantity of tomatoes, as determined by demand and supply, is efficient.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Efficiency and Equity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s03_p01">Consumer demands are affected by incomes. Demand, after all, reflects ability as well as willingness to pay for goods and services. The market will be more responsive to the preferences of people with high incomes than to those of people with low incomes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s03_p02">In a market that satisfies the efficiency condition, an efficient allocation of resources will emerge from any particular distribution of income. Different income distributions will result in different, but still efficient, outcomes. For example, if 1% of the population controls virtually all the income, then the market will efficiently allocate virtually all its production to those same people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s03_p03">What is a fair, or equitable, distribution of income? What is an unfair distribution? Should everyone have the same income? Is the current distribution fair? Should the rich have less and the poor have more? Should the middle class have more? Equity is very much in the mind of the observer. What may seem equitable to one person may seem inequitable to another. There is, however, no test we can apply to determine whether the distribution of income is or is not equitable. That question requires a normative judgment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s03_p04">Determining whether the allocation of resources is or is not efficient is one problem. Determining whether the distribution of income is fair is another. The governments of all nations act in some way to redistribute income. That fact suggests that people generally have concluded that leaving the distribution of income solely to the market would not be fair and that some redistribution is desirable. This may take the form of higher taxes for people with higher incomes than for those with lower incomes. It may take the form of special programs, such as welfare programs, for low-income people.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s03_p05">Whatever distribution society chooses, an efficient allocation of resources is still preferred to an inefficient one. Because an efficient allocation maximizes net benefits, the gain in net benefits could be distributed in a way that leaves all people better off than they would be at any inefficient allocation. If an efficient allocation of resources seems unfair, it must be because the distribution of income is unfair.</p>

            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s03_p12">Professor Joel Waldfogel, in his book <em class="emphasis">Scroogenomics</em>, derides Christmas gift giving as only an economist would. Based on repeated surveys from students in his classes (which asked them to compare value and price of gifts they received and of items they bought for themselves) and estimates of annual Christmas spending in the United States of $66 billion in 2007, he concludes that $12 billion, roughly 18% of the total, constituted deadweight loss. And that doesn’t count the 2.8 billion hours collectively spent shopping for the stuff. </p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s03_p13">The crux of his argument is that when you buy something for yourself, the price you pay is at least equal to the value of the satisfaction you get from the item. For some items, the consumer surplus (the difference between the value to you of the item and the price you pay), may be small or even zero, but for other items it may be large. One example he gives where consumer surplus may be huge is the purchase of a $20 antibiotic for your child with an ear infection who has been screaming all night. But what are the chances that consumer surplus will be positive for an item you receive as a gift? “Relative to how much satisfaction their [gift givers] expenditures could have given us, their choices destroy value. Take that, Santa,” writes Professor Waldfogel.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s03_p14">Doesn’t sentimental value make up for the differences between the price of an item you receive, say a $50 sweater, and the value you attach to it, say $25? If you attach $50 in sentimental value to the sweater, then it is really worth $75 to you, which is more than the $50 price paid by the gift giver. The problem with this line of argument is that if the gift giver had chosen a sweater for you that you actually liked—one that you valued at least at the purchase price of $50—its total value to you would then have been $100. Compared to giving you a sweater you actually liked, giving you the one you did not much care for destroyed value.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s03_p15">The surveys have also questioned the relationship of the gift giver to the gift recipient to see if giver knowledge of the recipient leads to more gift giving efficiency. The results are as one might expect. Gifts from aunts, uncles, and grandparents generated between 75 and 80 cents of satisfaction per dollar spent. Friends generated 91 cents, parents 97 cents, siblings 99 cents, and significant others 102 cents of satisfaction per dollar spent. In general, frequency of contact between giver and receiver increases the yield of a gift.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s03_p16">While acknowledging that there are some situations in which gifts may create value for recipients beyond what they could have purchased for themselves, such as when a recipient receives a CD of a band he or she was unfamiliar with but turns out to love, overall Waldfogel’s estimates reveal a great loss for society. What to do about it? Giving cash would work but there seems to be a stigma associated with doing so, especially for certain kinds of relationships between givers and receivers. Gift registries solve the problem for newlyweds and could do so for Christmas gifts if that idea caught on. Since outside of your immediate circle you are unlikely to select a gift that does not destroy value, he suggests giving cash, if that is not too uncomfortable, or gift cards, possibly ones for charitable causes. Of course, people often forget to use their gift cards. When that happens, the benefit is not lost but rather goes to the retailer, which was not likely the intention of the gift giver. He thus suggests that retailers team up with charities so that any amount not redeemed after a certain time period goes to a charity stated on the gift card. </p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s03_s03_p17">Parodying Karl Marx’s <em class="emphasis">Communist Manifesto</em>, he concludes, “A specter has been haunting the rich economies of the West, and that specter is wasteful gift giving. Gift givers of the world unite. You have nothing to lose but deadweight loss and a world of satisfaction to gain.”</p>

As a result, the net benefit of the allocation of resources such as the air might not be maximized.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s01_p01">The model of demand and supply assumes that markets are competitive. No one in these markets has any power over the equilibrium price; each consumer and producer takes the market price as given and responds to it. Under such conditions, price is determined by the intersection of demand and supply.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s01_p02">In some markets, however, individual buyers or sellers are powerful enough to influence the market price. In subsequent chapters, we will study cases in which producers or consumers are in a position to affect the prices they charge or must pay, respectively. We shall find that when individual firms or groups of firms have market power, which is the ability to change the market price, the price will be distorted—it will not equal marginal cost.</p>

The benefits of these goods are such that exclusion is not feasible. Once they are produced, anyone can enjoy them; there is no practical way to exclude people who have not paid for them from consuming them. Furthermore, the marginal cost of adding one more consumer is zero.

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s02_p02">National defense is a public good. Once defense is provided, it is not possible to exclude people who have not paid for it from its consumption.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s02_s01_p01">Suppose a private firm, Terror Alert, Inc., develops a completely reliable system to identify and intercept 98% of any would-be terrorists that might attempt to enter the United States from anywhere in the world. This service is a public good. Once it is provided, no one can be excluded from the system’s protection on grounds that he or she has not paid for it, and the cost of adding one more person to the group protected is zero. Suppose that the system, by eliminating a potential threat to U.S. security, makes the average person in the United States better off; the benefit to each household from the added security is worth $40 per month (about the same as an earthquake insurance premium). There are roughly 113 million households in the United States, so the total benefit of the system is $4.5 billion per month. Assume that it will cost Terror Alert, Inc., $1 billion per month to operate. The benefits of the system far outweigh the cost.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s02_s01_p02">Suppose that Terror Alert installs its system and sends a bill to each household for $20 for the first month of service—an amount equal to half of each household’s benefit. If each household pays its bill, Terror Alert will enjoy a tidy profit; it will receive revenues of more than $2.25 billion per month.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s02_s01_p03">But will each household pay? Once the system is in place, each household would recognize that it will benefit from the security provided by Terror Alert whether it pays its bill or not. Although some households will voluntarily pay their bills, it seems unlikely that very many will. Recognizing the opportunity to consume the good without paying for it, most would be free riders. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Free riders</a><span class="glossdef">People or firms that consume a public good without paying for it.</span></span> are people or firms that consume a public good without paying for it. Even though the total benefit of the system is $4.5 billion, Terror Alert will not be faced by the marketplace with a signal that suggests that the system is worthwhile. It is unlikely that it will recover its cost of $1 billion per month. Terror Alert is not likely to get off the ground.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s02_s01_p04">The bill for $20 from Terror Alert sends the wrong signal, too. An efficient market requires a price equal to marginal cost. But the marginal cost of protecting one more household is zero; adding one more household adds nothing to the cost of the system. A household that decides not to pay Terror Alert anything for its service is paying a price equal to its marginal cost. But doing that, being a free rider, is precisely what prevents Terror Alert from operating.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s02_s01_p05">Because no household can be excluded and because the cost of an extra household is zero, the efficiency condition will not be met in a private market.

In such cases, it may be desirable for government agencies to step in. Government can supply a greater quantity of the good by direct provision, by purchasing the public good from a private agency, or by subsidizing consumption. In any case, the cost is financed through taxation and thus avoids the free-rider problem.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s02_s02_p02">Most public goods are provided directly by government agencies. Governments produce national defense and law enforcement, for example. Private firms under contract with government agencies produce some public goods. Park maintenance and fire services are public goods that are sometimes produced by private firms. In other cases, the government promotes the private consumption or production of public goods by subsidizing them. Private charitable contributions often support activities that are public goods; federal and state governments subsidize these by allowing taxpayers to reduce their tax payments by a fraction of the amount they contribute.</p>

By the time a child who spends the average amount of time watching television finishes elementary school, he or she will have seen 100,000 acts of violence, including 8,000 murders, according to the American Psychological Association. Thousands of studies of the relationship between violence in the media and behavior have concluded that there is a link between watching violence and violent behaviors. Video games are a major element of the problem, as young children now spend hours each week playing them. Fifty percent of fourth-grade graders say that their favorite video games are the “first person shooter” type.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-rittenberg-fn06_001">See Report of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, <em class="emphasis">Children’s Protection From Violent Programming Act</em>, Senate Report 106–509 (October 26, 2000), Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 2000, and Michael Rich, “Violent Video Games Testimony,” Chicago City Council, October 30, 2000, at <a class="link" href="http://www.aap.org/advocacy/rich-videogameviolence.pdf">http://www.aap.org/advocacy/rich-videogameviolence.pdf</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s03_s02_p01">If an activity generates external costs, the decision makers generating the activity will not be faced with its full costs. Agents who impose these costs will carry out their activities beyond the efficient level; those who consume them, facing too low a price, will consume too much. As a result, producers and consumers will carry out an excessive quantity of the activity. In such cases, government may try to intervene to reduce the level of the activity toward the efficient quantity. In the case shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch06_s04_s03_s01_f01">Figure 6.11 "External Costs"</a>, for example, firms generating an external cost have a supply curve <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> that reflects their private marginal costs, <em class="emphasis">MC</em><sub class="subscript">p</sub>.

Taxes or other restrictions may be imposed on the activity that generates the external cost in an effort to confront decision makers with the costs that they are imposing. In many areas, firms and consumers that pollute rivers and lakes are required to pay fees based on the amount they pollute. Firms in many areas are required to purchase permits in order to pollute the air; the requirement that permits be purchased serves to confront the firms with the costs of their choices.</p>

The difficulty with common property resources is that individuals may not have adequate incentives to engage in efforts to preserve or protect them. Consider, for example, the relative fates of cattle and buffalo in the United States in the nineteenth century. Cattle populations increased throughout the century, while the buffalo nearly became extinct. The chief difference between the two animals was that exclusive property rights existed for cattle but not for buffalo.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s04_p02">Owners of cattle had an incentive to maintain herd sizes. A cattle owner who slaughtered all of his or her cattle without providing for replacement of the herd would not have a source of future income. Cattle owners not only maintained their herds but also engaged in extensive efforts to breed high-quality livestock. They invested time and effort in the efficient management of the resource on which their livelihoods depended.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s04_p03">Buffalo hunters surely had similar concerns about the maintenance of buffalo herds, but they had no individual stake in doing anything about them—the animals were a common property resource. Thousands of individuals hunted buffalo for a living. Anyone who cut back on hunting in order to help to preserve the herd would lose income—and face the likelihood that other hunters would go on hunting at the same rate as before.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s04_p04">Today, exclusive rights to buffalo have been widely established. The demand for buffalo meat, which is lower in fat than beef, has been increasing, but the number of buffalo in the United States is rising rapidly. If buffalo were still a common property resource, that increased demand, in the absence of other restrictions on hunting of the animals, would surely result in the elimination of the animal. Because there are exclusive, transferable property rights in buffalo and because a competitive market brings buyers and sellers of buffalo and buffalo products together, we can be reasonably confident in the efficient management of the animal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s04_p05">When a species is threatened with extinction, it is likely that no one has exclusive property rights to it. Whales, condors, grizzly bears, elephants in Central Africa—whatever the animal that is threatened—are common property resources. In such cases a government agency may impose limits on the killing of the animal or destruction of its habitat. Such limits can prevent the excessive private use of a common property resource. Alternatively, as was done in the case of the buffalo, private rights can be established, giving resource owners the task of preservation.</p>

            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s04_p11">Imagine that you are a rural landowner in Kenya. You grow crops, sell them, and earn a return. You raise livestock, sell them, and earn a return on them as well. Wild animals, from birds to elephants, are also found on your property, but you are severely restricted in terms of what you can do with them. In Kenya, wildlife ownership and user rights are largely the property of the state (i.e., wildlife is owned by all the citizens of Kenya). But if wild animals kill some of your cattle, the loss is entirely yours, as the state will not compensate you. And do not seriously think about offering wildlife viewing on your property because that is restricted by the state to about 5% of the rangelands where the wildlife are found. If crops and livestock were treated in the same way as wildlife in Kenya, how much of their production would continue in these areas? </p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s04_p12">Mike Norton-Griffiths, a long-time resident of Kenya and researcher of conservation and land use policy, argues that the lack of private property rights for wildlife explains why wild animal populations there have been dwindling. Since 1977, when Kenya banned all sport hunting and all other consumptive uses of wildlife, the large animal wildlife population there has fallen by 60 to 70%. Over the same period, human population has grown by more than 3% per year, crop production by more than 8% per year, and livestock population has been stable. </p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s04_p13">To reverse the decline in wildlife population, Norton-Griffiths argues that property rights for wildlife should be changed so that returns to wildlife become competitive with returns to crops and livestock. This would mean that rural landowners would be allowed to generate income from wildlife from activities such as sales of wildlife between landowners and to the public sector, ranching for local and overseas and local trade, sales of wildlife products, tanning, making of trophies and curios, and sport hunting.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s04_p14">Private property rights for wildlife (sometimes referred to as private sector conservation) have been established in much of southern Africa (South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe). In those countries, there exist over 9,000 private game ranches and 1,100 private nature reserves. These private areas engage in wildlife viewing services, sport hunting, live game sales, and bush meat production. </p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s04_p15">The bounce back in wildlife population in the southern African countries is remarkable, even though the animals may move from property to property. For example, the wildlife population on private game ranches in Namibia has increased by about 70%. Similarly in Europe, rural landowners have invested in raising game birds, even though the birds can move freely from property to property, because they can sell the rights to game bird hunting on their property.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s04_s04_p17">Peter Kareiva, the chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy, and Michelle Marvier, a professor at Santa Clara University, support a conservation-for-people approach. They argue that it does not make sense to pit people against nature. Rather, human well-being should become a part of biodiversity conservation efforts. If humans can benefit from managing wildlife, the wildlife may benefit as well.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s05_p01">Economists insist that individuals do not make choices willy-nilly. Rather, economists assume that individuals make choices in a purposeful way, one that seeks the maximum value for some objective. We assume that consumers seek to maximize utility and that firms seek to maximize profits.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s05_p02">Whatever is being maximized, choices are based on the marginal decision rule. Following this rule results in an allocation that achieves the greatest degree of utility or profit possible.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s05_p03">If utility- and profit-maximizing choices are made in the context of a price system that confronts decision makers with all of the costs and all of the benefits of their choices, the allocation of resources will be efficient. An efficient allocation is one that maximizes the net benefit of every activity. The concepts of consumer and producer surplus show us how this net benefit is shared. Equity is a separate issue, one that calls for a normative evaluation of the fairness of the distribution of income.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch06_s05_p04">The allocation of resources will be inefficient in the absence of competitive markets. It will also be inefficient if property rights are not exclusive and transferable. These two conditions break down when there are public goods, common property resources, or external benefits or costs. In each of these cases, public sector intervention may improve the efficiency of resource allocation. When a market fails to achieve the efficient solution, net benefit falls short of the maximum possible. Deadweight loss is the amount by which net benefit falls below the net benefit possible at the efficient solution.</p>
