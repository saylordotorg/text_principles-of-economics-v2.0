        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s00_p01">2008 turned out to be the worst holiday shopping season in decades. Why? U.S. consumers were battered from many directions. Housing prices had fallen nearly 20% over the year. The stock market had fallen over 40%. Interest rates were falling, but credit was extremely hard to come by. By December, consumer confidence hit an all-time low amid concerns of rising unemployment. Cutting back seemed like the best defense for weathering this tough environment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s00_p02">Consumption accounts for the bulk of aggregate demand in the United States and in other countries. In this chapter, we will examine the determinants of consumption and introduce a new model, the aggregate expenditures model, which will give insights into the aggregate demand curve. Any change in aggregate demand causes a change in income, and a change in income causes a change in consumption—which changes aggregate demand and thus income and thus consumption. The aggregate expenditures model will help us to unravel the important relationship between consumption and real GDP.</p>

The factors that determine consumption thus determine how successful an economy is in fulfilling its ultimate purpose: providing goods and services for people. So, consumption is not just important because it is such a large component of economic activity. It is important because, as McCulloch said, consumption is at the heart of the economy’s fundamental purpose.</p>

            <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s01_p07">It is important to note carefully the definition of the marginal propensity to consume. It is the change in consumption divided by the change in disposable personal income. It is not the level of consumption divided by the level of disposable personal income. Using <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s01_eq02" xrefstyle="select: label">Equation 28.2</a>, at a level of disposable personal income of $500 billion, for example, the level of consumption will be $700 billion so that the ratio of consumption to disposable personal income will be 1.4, while the marginal propensity to consume remains 0.8. The marginal propensity to consume is, as its name implies, a marginal concept. It tells us what will happen to an additional dollar of personal disposable income.</p>

The vertical intercept of the consumption function is thus $300 billion. Then, for every $500 billion increase in disposable personal income, consumption rises by $400 billion. Because the consumption function in our example is linear, its slope is the same between any two points. In this case, the slope of the consumption function, which is the same as the marginal propensity to consume, is 0.8 all along its length.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Current versus Permanent Income</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s02_p01">The discussion so far has related consumption in a particular period to income in that same period. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">current income hypothesis</a><span class="glossdef">Consumption in any one period depends on income during that period.</span></span> holds that consumption in any one period depends on income during that period, or current income.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s02_p02">Although it seems obvious that consumption should be related to disposable personal income, it is not so obvious that consumers base their consumption in any one period on the income they receive during that period. In buying a new car, for example, consumers might base their decision not only on their current income but on the income they expect to receive during the three or four years they expect to be making payments on the car. Parents who purchase a college education for their children might base their decision on their own expected lifetime income.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s02_p03">Indeed, it seems likely that virtually all consumption choices could be affected by expectations of income over a very long period. One reason people save is to provide funds to live on during their retirement years. Another is to build an estate they can leave to their heirs through bequests. The amount people save for their retirement or for bequests depends on the income they expect to receive for the rest of their lives. For these and other reasons, then, personal saving (and thus consumption) in any one year is influenced by permanent income. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Permanent income</a><span class="glossdef">The average annual income people expect to receive for the rest of their lives.</span></span> is the average annual income people expect to receive for the rest of their lives.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s02_p04">People who have the same current income but different permanent incomes might reach very different saving decisions. Someone with a relatively low current income but a high permanent income (a college student planning to go to medical school, for example) might save little or nothing now, expecting to save for retirement and for bequests later. A person with the same low income but no expectation of higher income later might try to save some money now to provide for retirement or bequests later. Because a decision to save a certain amount determines how much will be available for consumption, consumption decisions can also be affected by expected lifetime income. Thus, an alternative approach to explaining consumption behavior is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">permanent income hypothesis</a><span class="glossdef">Consumption in any period depends on permanent income.</span></span>, which assumes that consumption in any period depends on permanent income. An important implication of the permanent income hypothesis is that a change in income regarded as temporary will not affect consumption much, since it will have little effect on average lifetime income; a change regarded as permanent will have an effect. The current income hypothesis, though, predicts that it does not matter whether consumers view a change in disposable personal income as permanent or temporary; they will move along the consumption function and change consumption accordingly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s02_p05">The question of whether permanent or current income is a determinant of consumption arose in 1992 when President George H. W. Bush ordered a change in the withholding rate for personal income taxes. Workers have a fraction of their paychecks withheld for taxes each pay period; Mr. Bush directed that this fraction be reduced in 1992. The change in the withholding rate did not change income tax rates; by withholding less in 1992, taxpayers would either receive smaller refund checks in 1993 or owe more taxes. The change thus left taxpayers’ permanent income unaffected.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s02_p06">President Bush’s measure was designed to increase aggregate demand and close the recessionary gap created by the 1990–1991 recession. Economists who subscribed to the permanent income hypothesis predicted that the change would not have any effect on consumption. Those who subscribed to the current income hypothesis predicted that the measure would boost consumption substantially in 1992. A survey of households taken during this period suggested that households planned to spend about 43% of the temporary increase in disposable personal income produced by the withholding experiment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-rittenmacro-fn13_002">Matthew D. Shapiro and Joel Slemrod, “Consumer Response to the Timing of Income: Evidence from a Change in Tax Withholding,” <em class="emphasis">American Economic Review</em> 85 (March 1995): 274–83.</span> That is considerably less than would be predicted by the current income hypothesis, but more than the zero change predicted by the permanent income hypothesis. This result, together with related evidence, suggests that temporary changes in income can affect consumption, but that changes regarded as permanent will have a much stronger impact.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s02_p07">Many of the tax cuts passed during the administration of President George W. Bush are set to expire at the end of 2012. The proposal to make these tax cuts permanent is aimed toward having a stronger impact on consumption, since tax cuts regarded as permanent have larger effects than do changes regarded as temporary.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s03_s02_p01">Consumers are likely to be more willing to spend money when they are optimistic about the future. Surveyors attempt to gauge this optimism using “consumer confidence” surveys that ask respondents to report whether they are optimistic or pessimistic about their own economic situation and about the prospects for the economy as a whole. An increase in consumer optimism tends to shift the consumption function upward as in Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s03_f01">Figure 28.4 "Shifts in the Consumption Function"</a>; an increase in pessimism tends to shift it downward as in Panel (b).

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s03_s02_p02">The relationship between consumption and consumer expectations concerning future economic conditions tends to be a form of self-fulfilling prophecy. If consumers expect economic conditions to worsen, they will cut their consumption—and economic conditions will worsen! Political leaders often try to persuade people that economic prospects are good. In part, such efforts are an attempt to increase economic activity by boosting consumption.</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s03_s02_p04">The first round of the Bush tax cuts was passed in 2001. Democrats in Congress insisted on a rebate aimed at stimulating consumption. In the summer of 2001, rebates of $300 per single taxpayer and of $600 for married couples were distributed. The Department of Treasury reported that 92 million people received the rebates. While the rebates were intended to stimulate consumption, the extent to which the tax rebates stimulated consumption, especially during the recession, is an empirical question.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s03_s02_p05">It is difficult to analyze the impact of a tax rebate that is a single event experienced by all households at the same time. If spending does change at that moment, is it because of the tax rebate or because of some other event that occurred at that time?</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s03_s02_p06">Fortunately for researchers Sumit Agarwal, Chunlin Liu, and Nicholas Souleles, using data from credit card accounts, the 2001 tax rebate checks were distributed over 10 successive weeks from July to September of 2001. The timing of receipt was random, since it was based on the next-to-last digit of one’s Social Security number, and taxpayers were informed well in advance that the checks were coming. The researchers found that consumers initially saved much of their rebates, by paying down their credit card debts, but over a nine-month period, spending increased to about 40% of the rebate. They also found that consumers who were most liquidity constrained (for example, close to their credit card debt limits) spent more than consumers who were less constrained.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s03_s02_p07">The researchers thus conclude that their findings do not support the permanent income hypothesis, since consumers responded to spending based on when they received their checks and because the results indicate that consumers do respond to what they call “lumpy” changes in income, such as those generated by a tax rebate. In other words, current income does seem to matter.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s01_s03_s02_p08">Two other studies of the 2001 tax rebate reached somewhat different conclusions. Using survey data, researchers Matthew D. Shapiro and Joel Slemrod estimated an <em class="emphasis">MPC</em> of about one-third. They note that this low increased spending is particularly surprising, since the rebate was part of a general tax cut that was expected to last a long time. At the other end, David S. Johnson, Jonathan A. Parker, and Nicholas S. Souleles, using yet another data set, found that looking over a six-month period, the <em class="emphasis">MPC</em> was about two-thirds. So, while there is disagreement on the size of the <em class="emphasis">MPC</em>, all conclude that the impact was non-negligible.</p>

In this section, we incorporate other components of aggregate demand: investment, government purchases, and net exports. In doing so, we shall develop a new model of the determination of equilibrium real GDP, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aggregate expenditures model</a><span class="glossdef">Model that relates aggregate expenditures to the level of real GDP.</span></span>. This model relates <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aggregate expenditures</a><span class="glossdef">The sum of planned levels of consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports at a given price level.</span></span>, which equal the sum of planned levels of consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports at a given price level, to the level of real GDP. We shall see that people, firms, and government agencies may not always spend what they had planned to spend. If so, then actual real GDP will not be the same as aggregate expenditures, and the economy will not be at the equilibrium level of real GDP.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_p02">One purpose of examining the aggregate expenditures model is to gain a deeper understanding of the “ripple effects” from a change in one or more components of aggregate demand. As we saw in the chapter that introduced the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model, a change in investment, government purchases, or net exports leads to greater production; this creates additional income for households, which induces additional consumption, leading to more production, more income, more consumption, and so on. The aggregate expenditures model provides a context within which this series of ripple effects can be better understood. A second reason for introducing the model is that we can use it to derive the aggregate demand curve for the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_p03">To see how the aggregate expenditures model works, we begin with a very simplified model in which there is neither a government sector nor a foreign sector. Then we use the findings based on this simplified model to build a more realistic model. The equations for the simplified economy are easier to work with, and we can readily apply the conclusions reached from analyzing a simplified economy to draw conclusions about a more realistic one.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_p01">To develop a simple model, we assume that there are only two components of aggregate expenditures: consumption and investment. In the chapter on measuring total output and income, we learned that real gross domestic product and real gross domestic income are the same thing. With no government or foreign sector, gross domestic income in this economy and disposable personal income would be nearly the same. To simplify further, we will assume that depreciation and undistributed corporate profits (retained earnings) are zero. Thus, for this example, we assume that disposable personal income and real GDP are identical.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_p02">Finally, we shall also assume that the only component of aggregate expenditures that may not be at the planned level is investment. Firms determine a level of investment they intend to make in each period. The level of investment firms intend to make in a period is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">planned investment</a><span class="glossdef">The level of investment firms intend to make in a period.</span></span>. Some investment is unplanned. Suppose, for example, that firms produce and expect to sell more goods during a period than they actually sell. The unsold goods will be added to the firms’ inventories, and they will thus be counted as part of investment. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Unplanned investment</a><span class="glossdef">Investment during a period that firms did not intend to make.</span></span> is investment during a period that firms did not intend to make. It is also possible that firms may sell more than they had expected. In this case, inventories will fall below what firms expected, in which case, unplanned investment would be negative. Investment during a period equals the sum of planned investment (<em class="emphasis">I</em><sub class="subscript">P</sub>) and unplanned investment (<em class="emphasis">I</em><sub class="subscript">U</sub>).</p>

Aggregate expenditures equal total planned spending on that output. Equilibrium in the model occurs where aggregate expenditures in some period equal real GDP in that period. One way to think about equilibrium is to recognize that firms, except for some inventory that they plan to hold, produce goods and services with the intention of selling them. Aggregate expenditures consist of what people, firms, and government agencies plan to spend. If the economy is at its equilibrium real GDP, then firms are selling what they plan to sell (that is, there are no unplanned changes in inventories).</p>

The answer lies in the operation of the multiplier. Because firms have increased their demand for investment goods (that is, for capital) by $300 billion, the firms that produce those goods will have $300 billion in additional orders. They will produce $300 billion in additional real GDP and, given our simplifying assumption, $300 billion in additional disposable personal income. But in this economy, each $1 of additional real GDP induces $0.80 in additional consumption. The $300 billion increase in autonomous aggregate expenditures initially induces $240 billion (= 0.8 × $300 billion) in additional consumption.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s06_p04">The $240 billion in additional consumption boosts production, creating another $240 billion in real GDP. But that second round of increase in real GDP induces $192 billion (= 0.8 × $240) in additional consumption, creating still more production, still more income, and still more consumption. Eventually (after many additional rounds of increases in induced consumption), the $300 billion increase in aggregate expenditures will result in a $1,500 billion increase in equilibrium real GDP. <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s06_t01">Table 28.1 "The Multiplied Effect of an Increase in Autonomous Aggregate Expenditures"</a> shows the multiplied effect of a $300 billion increase in autonomous aggregate expenditures, assuming each $1 of additional real GDP induces $0.80 in additional consumption.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s06_p05">The size of the additional rounds of expenditure is based on the slope of the aggregate expenditures function, which in this example is simply the marginal propensity to consume. Had the slope been flatter (if the marginal propensity to consume were smaller), the additional rounds of spending would have been smaller. A steeper slope would mean that the additional rounds of spending would have been larger.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s06_p06">This process could also work in reverse. That is, a decrease in planned investment would lead to a multiplied decrease in real GDP. A reduction in planned investment would reduce the incomes of some households. They would reduce their consumption by the <em class="emphasis">MPC</em> times the reduction in their income. That, in turn, would reduce incomes for households that would have received the spending by the first group of households. The process continues, thus multiplying the impact of the reduction in aggregate expenditures resulting from the reduction in planned investment.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s06_s01_p04">The multiplier effect works because a change in autonomous aggregate expenditures causes a change in real GDP and disposable personal income, inducing a further change in the level of aggregate expenditures, which creates still more GDP and thus an even higher level of aggregate expenditures. The degree to which a given change in real GDP induces a change in aggregate expenditures is given in this simplified economy by the marginal propensity to consume, which, in this case, is the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve. The slope of the aggregate expenditures curve is thus linked to the size of the multiplier. We turn now to an investigation of the relationship between the marginal propensity to consume and the multiplier.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s01_p02">As before, we assume that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, but we now add the assumption that income taxes take ¼ of real GDP. This means that for every additional $1 of real GDP, disposable personal income rises by $0.75 and, in turn, consumption rises by $0.60 (= 0.8 × $0.75). In the simplified model in which disposable personal income and real GDP were the same, an additional $1 of real GDP raised consumption by $0.80. The slope of the aggregate expenditures curve was 0.8, the marginal propensity to consume. Now, as a result of taxes, the aggregate expenditures curve will be flatter than the one shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s03_f01">Figure 28.7 "Plotting the Aggregate Expenditures Curve"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s05_f02">Figure 28.9 "Adjusting to Equilibrium Real GDP"</a>. In this example, the slope will be 0.6; an additional $1 of real GDP will increase consumption by $0.60.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s01_p03">Other things the same, the multiplier will be smaller than it was in the simplified economy in which disposable personal income and real GDP were identical. The wedge between disposable personal income and real GDP created by taxes means that the additional rounds of spending induced by a change in autonomous aggregate expenditures will be smaller than if there were no taxes. Hence, the multiplied effect of any change in autonomous aggregate expenditures is smaller.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p03">There are two major differences between the aggregate expenditures curves shown in the two panels. Notice first that the intercept of the <em class="emphasis">AE</em> curve in Panel (b) is higher than that of the <em class="emphasis">AE</em> curve in Panel (a). The reason is that, in addition to the autonomous part of consumption and planned investment, there are two other components of aggregate expenditures—government purchases and net exports—that we have also assumed are autonomous. Thus, the intercept of the aggregate expenditures curve in Panel (b) is the sum of the four autonomous aggregate expenditures components: consumption (<em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript">a</sub>), planned investment (<em class="emphasis">I</em><sub class="subscript">P</sub>), government purchases (<em class="emphasis">G</em>), and net exports (<em class="emphasis">X</em><sub class="subscript">n</sub>). In Panel (a), the intercept includes only the first two components.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p04">Second, notice that the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve is flatter for the more realistic economy in Panel (b) than it is for the simplified economy in Panel (a). This can be seen by comparing the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve between points A and B in Panel (a) to the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve between points A′ and B′ in Panel (b). Between both sets of points, real GDP changes by the same amount, $1,000 billion. In Panel (a), consumption rises by $800 billion, whereas in Panel (b) consumption rises by only $600 billion. This difference occurs because, in the more realistic view of the economy, households have only a fraction of real GDP available as disposable personal income. Thus, for a given change in real GDP, consumption rises by a smaller amount.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p05">Let us examine what happens to equilibrium real GDP in each case if there is a shift in autonomous aggregate expenditures, such as an increase in planned investment, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_f02">Figure 28.12 "A Change in Autonomous Aggregate Expenditures: Comparison of a Simplified Economy and a More Realistic Economy"</a>. In both panels, the initial level of equilibrium real GDP is the same, <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>. Equilibrium real GDP occurs where the given aggregate expenditures curve intersects the 45-degree line. The aggregate expenditures curve shifts up by the same amount—Δ<em class="emphasis">A</em> is the same in both panels. The new level of equilibrium real GDP occurs where the new <em class="emphasis">AE</em> curve intersects the 45-degree line. In Panel (a), we see that the new level of equilibrium real GDP rises to <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>, but in Panel (b) it rises only to <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">3</sub>. Since the same change in autonomous aggregate expenditures led to a greater increase in equilibrium real GDP in Panel (a) than in Panel (b), the multiplier for the more realistic model of the economy must be smaller. The multiplier is smaller, of course, because the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve is flatter.</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p07">It was the first time expansionary fiscal policy had ever been proposed. The economy had slipped into a recession in 1960. Presidential candidate John Kennedy received proposals from several economists that year for a tax cut aimed at stimulating the economy. As a candidate, he was unconvinced. But, as president he proposed the tax cut in 1962. His chief economic adviser, Walter Heller, defended the tax cut idea before Congress and introduced what was politically a novel concept: the multiplier.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p08">In testimony to the Senate Subcommittee on Employment and Manpower, Mr. Heller predicted that a $10 billion cut in personal income taxes would boost consumption “by over $9 billion.”</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p09">To assess the ultimate impact of the tax cut, Mr. Heller applied the aggregate expenditures model. He rounded the increased consumption off to $9 billion and explained,</p>
                <span class="blockquote" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_bl01">
                    <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p10">“This is far from the end of the matter. The higher production of consumer goods to meet this extra spending would mean extra employment, higher payrolls, higher profits, and higher farm and professional and service incomes. This added purchasing power would generate still further increases in spending and incomes. … The initial rise of $9 billion, plus this extra consumption spending and extra output of consumer goods, would add over $18 billion to our annual GDP.”</p>
                </span>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p11">We can summarize this continuing process by saying that a “multiplier” of approximately 2 has been applied to the direct increment of consumption spending.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p12">Mr. Heller also predicted that proposed cuts in corporate income tax rates would increase investment by about $6 billion. The total change in autonomous aggregate expenditures would thus be $15 billion: $9 billion in consumption and $6 billion in investment. He predicted that the total increase in equilibrium GDP would be $30 billion, the amount the Council of Economic Advisers had estimated would be necessary to reach full employment.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p13">In the end, the tax cut was not passed until 1964, after President Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. While the Council of Economic Advisers concluded that the tax cut had worked as advertised, it came long after the economy had recovered and tended to push the economy into an inflationary gap. As we will see in later chapters, the tax cut helped push the economy into a period of rising inflation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Aggregate Expenditures Curves and Price Levels</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s01_p01">An aggregate expenditures curve assumes a fixed price level. If the price level were to change, the levels of consumption, investment, and net exports would all change, producing a new aggregate expenditures curve and a new equilibrium solution in the aggregate expenditures model.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s01_p02">A change in the price level changes people’s real wealth. Suppose, for example, that your wealth includes $10,000 in a bond account. An increase in the price level would reduce the real value of this money, reduce your real wealth, and thus reduce your consumption. Similarly, a reduction in the price level would increase the real value of money holdings and thus increase real wealth and consumption. The tendency for price level changes to change real wealth and consumption is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wealth effect</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency for price level changes to change real wealth and consumption.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s01_p03">Because changes in the price level also affect the real quantity of money, we can expect a change in the price level to change the interest rate. A reduction in the price level will increase the real quantity of money and thus lower the interest rate. A lower interest rate, all other things unchanged, will increase the level of investment. Similarly, a higher price level reduces the real quantity of money, raises interest rates, and reduces investment. This is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interest rate effect</a><span class="glossdef">The tendency for a higher price level to reduce the real quantity of money, raise interest rates, and reduce investment.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s01_p04">Finally, a change in the domestic price level will affect exports and imports. A higher price level makes a country’s exports fall and imports rise, reducing net exports. A lower price level will increase exports and reduce imports, increasing net exports. This impact of different price levels on the level of net exports is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">international trade effect</a><span class="glossdef">The impact of different price levels on the level of net exports.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s01_p05">Panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s01_f01">Figure 28.13 "From Aggregate Expenditures to Aggregate Demand"</a> shows three possible aggregate expenditures curves for three different price levels. For example, the aggregate expenditures curve labeled <em class="emphasis">AE</em><sub class="subscript">P=1.0</sub> is the aggregate expenditures curve for an economy with a price level of 1.0. Since that aggregate expenditures curve crosses the 45-degree line at $6,000 billion, equilibrium real GDP is $6,000 billion at that price level. At a lower price level, aggregate expenditures would rise because of the wealth effect, the interest rate effect, and the international trade effect. Assume that at every level of real GDP, a reduction in the price level to 0.5 would boost aggregate expenditures by $2,000 billion to <em class="emphasis">AE</em><sub class="subscript">P = 0.5</sub>, and an increase in the price level from 1.0 to 1.5 would reduce aggregate expenditures by $2,000 billion. The aggregate expenditures curve for a price level of 1.5 is shown as <em class="emphasis">AE</em><sub class="subscript">P=1.5</sub>. There is a different aggregate expenditures curve, and a different level of equilibrium real GDP, for each of these three price levels. A price level of 1.5 produces equilibrium at point A, a price level of 1.0 does so at point B, and a price level of 0.5 does so at point C. More generally, there will be a different level of equilibrium real GDP for every price level; the higher the price level, the lower the equilibrium value of real GDP.</p>

The aggregate expenditures curve for a price level of 1.0, for example, intersects the 45-degree line in Panel (a) at point B, producing an equilibrium real GDP of $6,000 billion.

The equilibrium real GDP associated with each price level in the aggregate expenditures model is plotted as a point showing the price level and the quantity of goods and services demanded (measured as real GDP). At a price level of 1.0, for example, the equilibrium level of real GDP in the aggregate expenditures model in Panel (a) is $6,000 billion at point B. That means $6,000 billion worth of goods and services is demanded; point B' on the aggregate demand curve in Panel (b) corresponds to a real GDP demanded of $6,000 billion and a price level of 1.0. At a price level of 0.5 the equilibrium GDP demanded is $10,000 billion at point C', and at a price level of 1.5 the equilibrium real GDP demanded is $2,000 billion at point A'. The aggregate demand curve thus shows the equilibrium real GDP from the aggregate expenditures model at each price level.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s02_p01">In the aggregate expenditures model, a change in autonomous aggregate expenditures changes equilibrium real GDP by the multiplier times the change in autonomous aggregate expenditures.

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s02_p03">A $1,000-billion increase in net exports shifts each of the aggregate expenditures curves up by $1,000 billion, to <em class="emphasis">AE</em>′<sub class="subscript">P=1.0</sub> and <em class="emphasis">AE</em>′<sub class="subscript">P=1.5</sub>.

In the aggregate expenditures model, equilibrium real GDP changes by an amount equal to the initial change in autonomous aggregate expenditures times the multiplier, so the aggregate demand curve shifts by the same amount.

            <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s03_s02_p06">Using a large-scale model of the U.S. economy to simulate the effects of government policies, Princeton University professor Alan Blinder and Moody Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi concluded that the expansionary fiscal, monetary, and other policies aimed at relieving the financial crisis (such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP) worked together from 2008 onward to effectively combat the Great Recession and probably kept it from turning into the Great Depression 2.0. Specifically, they estimated that U.S. GDP would have fallen about 12% peak-to-trough and that the unemployment rate would have hit 16.5% without these policies, instead of GDP declining about 4% and the unemployment rate reaching about 10%. While they attribute the bulk of the improvement to monetary and other financial policies, they found that fiscal policies also played a substantial role. For example, they concluded that fiscal stimulus added more than 3% to real GDP in 2010.</p>

The following table provides estimates for the multiplied effects of various stimulus measures that were considered.

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s04_p01">This chapter presented the aggregate expenditures model. Aggregate expenditures are the sum of planned levels of consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports at a given price level. The aggregate expenditures model relates aggregate expenditures to the level of real GDP.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s04_p02">We began by observing the close relationship between consumption and disposable personal income. A consumption function shows this relationship. The saving function can be derived from the consumption function.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s04_p03">The time period over which income is considered to be a determinant of consumption is important. The current income hypothesis holds that consumption in one period is a function of income in that same period. The permanent income hypothesis holds that consumption in a period is a function of permanent income. An important implication of the permanent income hypothesis is that the marginal propensity to consume will be smaller for temporary than for permanent changes in disposable personal income.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s04_p04">Changes in real wealth and consumer expectations can affect the consumption function. Such changes shift the curve relating consumption to disposable personal income, the graphical representation of the consumption function; changes in disposable personal income do not shift the curve but cause movements along it.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s04_p05">An aggregate expenditures curve shows total planned expenditures at each level of real GDP. This curve is used in the aggregate expenditures model to determine the equilibrium real GDP (at a given price level). A change in autonomous aggregate expenditures produces a multiplier effect that leads to a larger change in equilibrium real GDP. In a simplified economy, with only consumption and investment expenditures, in which the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve is the marginal propensity to consume (<em class="emphasis">MPC</em>), the multiplier is equal to 1/(1 − <em class="emphasis">MPC</em>). Because the sum of the marginal propensity to consume and the marginal propensity to save (<em class="emphasis">MPS</em>) is 1, the multiplier in this simplified model is also equal to 1/<em class="emphasis">MPS</em>.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s04_p06">Finally, we derived the aggregate demand curve from the aggregate expenditures model. Each point on the aggregate demand curve corresponds to the equilibrium level of real GDP as derived in the aggregate expenditures model for each price level. The downward slope of the aggregate demand curve (and the shifting of the aggregate expenditures curve at each price level) reflects the wealth effect, the interest rate effect, and the international trade effect. A change in autonomous aggregate expenditures shifts the aggregate demand curve by an amount equal to the change in autonomous aggregate expenditures times the multiplier.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s04_p07">In a more realistic aggregate expenditures model that includes all four components of aggregate expenditures (consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports), the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve shows the additional aggregate expenditures induced by increases in real GDP, and the size of the multiplier depends on the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve. The steeper the aggregate expenditures curve, the larger the multiplier; the flatter the aggregate expenditures curve, the smaller the multiplier.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Concept Problems</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s04_l01">
            <li>Explain the difference between autonomous and induced expenditures. Give examples of each.</li>
            <li>The consumption function we studied in the chapter predicted that consumption would sometimes exceed disposable personal income. How could this be?</li>
            <li>The consumption function can be represented as a table, as an equation, or as a curve. Distinguish among these three representations.</li>
            <li>The introduction to this chapter described the behavior of consumer spending at the end of 2008. Explain this phenomenon in terms of the analysis presented in this chapter.</li>
            <li>Explain the role played by the 45-degree line in the aggregate expenditures model.</li>
            <li>Your college or university, if it does what many others do, occasionally releases a news story claiming that its impact on the total employment in the local economy is understated by its own employment statistics. If the institution keeps accurate statistics, is that possible?</li>
            <li>Suppose the level of investment in a certain economy changes when the level of real GDP changes; an increase in real GDP induces an increase in investment, while a reduction in real GDP causes investment to fall. How do you think such behavior would affect the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve? The multiplier?</li>
            <li>Give an intuitive explanation for how the multiplier works on a reduction in autonomous aggregate expenditures. Why does equilibrium real GDP fall by more than the change in autonomous aggregate expenditures?</li>
            <li>Explain why the marginal propensity to consume out of a temporary tax rebate would be lower than that for a permanent rebate.</li>
            <li>Pretend you are a member of the Council of Economic Advisers and are trying to persuade the members of the House Appropriations Committee to purchase $100 billion worth of new materials, in part to stimulate the economy. Explain to the members how the multiplier process will work.</li>
