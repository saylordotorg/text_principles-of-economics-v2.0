    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_p01">The consumption function relates the level of consumption in a period to the level of disposable personal income in that period. In this section, we incorporate other components of aggregate demand: investment, government purchases, and net exports. In doing so, we shall develop a new model of the determination of equilibrium real GDP, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aggregate expenditures model</a><span class="glossdef">Model that relates aggregate expenditures to the level of real GDP.</span></span>. This model relates <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aggregate expenditures</a><span class="glossdef">The sum of planned levels of consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports at a given price level.</span></span>, which equal the sum of planned levels of consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports at a given price level, to the level of real GDP. We shall see that people, firms, and government agencies may not always spend what they had planned to spend. If so, then actual real GDP will not be the same as aggregate expenditures, and the economy will not be at the equilibrium level of real GDP.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_p02">One purpose of examining the aggregate expenditures model is to gain a deeper understanding of the “ripple effects” from a change in one or more components of aggregate demand. As we saw in the chapter that introduced the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model, a change in investment, government purchases, or net exports leads to greater production; this creates additional income for households, which induces additional consumption, leading to more production, more income, more consumption, and so on. The aggregate expenditures model provides a context within which this series of ripple effects can be better understood. A second reason for introducing the model is that we can use it to derive the aggregate demand curve for the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_p03">To see how the aggregate expenditures model works, we begin with a very simplified model in which there is neither a government sector nor a foreign sector. Then we use the findings based on this simplified model to build a more realistic model. The equations for the simplified economy are easier to work with, and we can readily apply the conclusions reached from analyzing a simplified economy to draw conclusions about a more realistic one.</p>
    <div class="section" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Aggregate Expenditures Model: A Simplified View</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_p01">To develop a simple model, we assume that there are only two components of aggregate expenditures: consumption and investment. In the chapter on measuring total output and income, we learned that real gross domestic product and real gross domestic income are the same thing. With no government or foreign sector, gross domestic income in this economy and disposable personal income would be nearly the same. To simplify further, we will assume that depreciation and undistributed corporate profits (retained earnings) are zero. Thus, for this example, we assume that disposable personal income and real GDP are identical.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_p02">Finally, we shall also assume that the only component of aggregate expenditures that may not be at the planned level is investment. Firms determine a level of investment they intend to make in each period. The level of investment firms intend to make in a period is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">planned investment</a><span class="glossdef">The level of investment firms intend to make in a period.</span></span>. Some investment is unplanned. Suppose, for example, that firms produce and expect to sell more goods during a period than they actually sell. The unsold goods will be added to the firms’ inventories, and they will thus be counted as part of investment. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Unplanned investment</a><span class="glossdef">Investment during a period that firms did not intend to make.</span></span> is investment during a period that firms did not intend to make. It is also possible that firms may sell more than they had expected. In this case, inventories will fall below what firms expected, in which case, unplanned investment would be negative. Investment during a period equals the sum of planned investment (<em class="emphasis">I</em><sub class="subscript">P</sub>) and unplanned investment (<em class="emphasis">I</em><sub class="subscript">U</sub>).</p>

Aggregate expenditures equal total planned spending on that output. Equilibrium in the model occurs where aggregate expenditures in some period equal real GDP in that period. One way to think about equilibrium is to recognize that firms, except for some inventory that they plan to hold, produce goods and services with the intention of selling them. Aggregate expenditures consist of what people, firms, and government agencies plan to spend. If the economy is at its equilibrium real GDP, then firms are selling what they plan to sell (that is, there are no unplanned changes in inventories).</p>

Their actual level of investment would be $400 billion greater than their planned level of investment. With those unsold goods on hand (that is, with an unplanned increase in inventories), firms would be likely to cut their output, moving the economy toward its equilibrium GDP of $7,000 billion. If firms were to produce $5,000 billion, aggregate expenditures would be $5,400 billion. Consumers and firms would demand more than was produced; firms would respond by reducing their inventories below the planned level (that is, there would be an unplanned decrease in inventories) and increasing their output in subsequent periods, again moving the economy toward its equilibrium real GDP of $7,000 billion. <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s05_f02">Figure 28.9 "Adjusting to Equilibrium Real GDP"</a> shows possible levels of real GDP in the economy for the aggregate expenditures function illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s05_f01">Figure 28.8 "Determining Equilibrium in the Aggregate Expenditures Model"</a>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s06_p01">In the aggregate expenditures model, equilibrium is found at the level of real GDP at which the aggregate expenditures curve crosses the 45-degree line. It follows that a shift in the curve will change equilibrium real GDP. Here we will examine the magnitude of such changes.</p>

Now suppose that planned investment increases from the original value of $1,100 billion to a new value of $1,400 billion—an increase of $300 billion. This increase in planned investment shifts the aggregate expenditures curve upward by $300 billion, all other things unchanged. Notice, however, that the new aggregate expenditures curve intersects the 45-degree line at a real GDP of $8,500 billion. The $300 billion increase in planned investment has produced an increase in equilibrium real GDP of $1,500 billion.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s06_p03">How could an increase in aggregate expenditures of $300 billion produce an increase in equilibrium real GDP of $1,500 billion? The answer lies in the operation of the multiplier. Because firms have increased their demand for investment goods (that is, for capital) by $300 billion, the firms that produce those goods will have $300 billion in additional orders. They will produce $300 billion in additional real GDP and, given our simplifying assumption, $300 billion in additional disposable personal income. But in this economy, each $1 of additional real GDP induces $0.80 in additional consumption. The $300 billion increase in autonomous aggregate expenditures initially induces $240 billion (= 0.8 × $300 billion) in additional consumption.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s06_p04">The $240 billion in additional consumption boosts production, creating another $240 billion in real GDP. But that second round of increase in real GDP induces $192 billion (= 0.8 × $240) in additional consumption, creating still more production, still more income, and still more consumption. Eventually (after many additional rounds of increases in induced consumption), the $300 billion increase in aggregate expenditures will result in a $1,500 billion increase in equilibrium real GDP. <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s06_t01">Table 28.1 "The Multiplied Effect of an Increase in Autonomous Aggregate Expenditures"</a> shows the multiplied effect of a $300 billion increase in autonomous aggregate expenditures, assuming each $1 of additional real GDP induces $0.80 in additional consumption.</p>

A steeper slope would mean that the additional rounds of spending would have been larger.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s06_p06">This process could also work in reverse. That is, a decrease in planned investment would lead to a multiplied decrease in real GDP. A reduction in planned investment would reduce the incomes of some households. They would reduce their consumption by the <em class="emphasis">MPC</em> times the reduction in their income. That, in turn, would reduce incomes for households that would have received the spending by the first group of households. The process continues, thus multiplying the impact of the reduction in aggregate expenditures resulting from the reduction in planned investment.</p>

The degree to which a given change in real GDP induces a change in aggregate expenditures is given in this simplified economy by the marginal propensity to consume, which, in this case, is the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s01_p02">As before, we assume that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, but we now add the assumption that income taxes take ¼ of real GDP. This means that for every additional $1 of real GDP, disposable personal income rises by $0.75 and, in turn, consumption rises by $0.60 (= 0.8 × $0.75). In the simplified model in which disposable personal income and real GDP were the same, an additional $1 of real GDP raised consumption by $0.80. The slope of the aggregate expenditures curve was 0.8, the marginal propensity to consume. Now, as a result of taxes, the aggregate expenditures curve will be flatter than the one shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s03_f01">Figure 28.7 "Plotting the Aggregate Expenditures Curve"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s01_s05_f02">Figure 28.9 "Adjusting to Equilibrium Real GDP"</a>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s01_p03">Other things the same, the multiplier will be smaller than it was in the simplified economy in which disposable personal income and real GDP were identical. The wedge between disposable personal income and real GDP created by taxes means that the additional rounds of spending induced by a change in autonomous aggregate expenditures will be smaller than if there were no taxes. Hence, the multiplied effect of any change in autonomous aggregate expenditures is smaller.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p03">There are two major differences between the aggregate expenditures curves shown in the two panels. Notice first that the intercept of the <em class="emphasis">AE</em> curve in Panel (b) is higher than that of the <em class="emphasis">AE</em> curve in Panel (a). The reason is that, in addition to the autonomous part of consumption and planned investment, there are two other components of aggregate expenditures—government purchases and net exports—that we have also assumed are autonomous. Thus, the intercept of the aggregate expenditures curve in Panel (b) is the sum of the four autonomous aggregate expenditures components: consumption (<em class="emphasis">C</em><sub class="subscript">a</sub>), planned investment (<em class="emphasis">I</em><sub class="subscript">P</sub>), government purchases (<em class="emphasis">G</em>), and net exports (<em class="emphasis">X</em><sub class="subscript">n</sub>). In Panel (a), the intercept includes only the first two components.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p04">Second, notice that the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve is flatter for the more realistic economy in Panel (b) than it is for the simplified economy in Panel (a). This can be seen by comparing the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve between points A and B in Panel (a) to the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve between points A′ and B′ in Panel (b). Between both sets of points, real GDP changes by the same amount, $1,000 billion. In Panel (a), consumption rises by $800 billion, whereas in Panel (b) consumption rises by only $600 billion. This difference occurs because, in the more realistic view of the economy, households have only a fraction of real GDP available as disposable personal income. Thus, for a given change in real GDP, consumption rises by a smaller amount.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p05">Let us examine what happens to equilibrium real GDP in each case if there is a shift in autonomous aggregate expenditures, such as an increase in planned investment, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_f02">Figure 28.12 "A Change in Autonomous Aggregate Expenditures: Comparison of a Simplified Economy and a More Realistic Economy"</a>. In both panels, the initial level of equilibrium real GDP is the same, <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub>. Equilibrium real GDP occurs where the given aggregate expenditures curve intersects the 45-degree line. The aggregate expenditures curve shifts up by the same amount—Δ<em class="emphasis">A</em> is the same in both panels. The new level of equilibrium real GDP occurs where the new <em class="emphasis">AE</em> curve intersects the 45-degree line. In Panel (a), we see that the new level of equilibrium real GDP rises to <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>, but in Panel (b) it rises only to <em class="emphasis">Y</em><sub class="subscript">3</sub>. Since the same change in autonomous aggregate expenditures led to a greater increase in equilibrium real GDP in Panel (a) than in Panel (b), the multiplier for the more realistic model of the economy must be smaller. The multiplier is smaller, of course, because the slope of the aggregate expenditures curve is flatter.</p>

Presidential candidate John Kennedy received proposals from several economists that year for a tax cut aimed at stimulating the economy. As a candidate, he was unconvinced. But, as president he proposed the tax cut in 1962. His chief economic adviser, Walter Heller, defended the tax cut idea before Congress and introduced what was politically a novel concept: the multiplier.</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p09">To assess the ultimate impact of the tax cut, Mr. Heller applied the aggregate expenditures model. He rounded the increased consumption off to $9 billion and explained,</p>
                <span class="blockquote" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_bl01">
                    <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p10">“This is far from the end of the matter. The higher production of consumer goods to meet this extra spending would mean extra employment, higher payrolls, higher profits, and higher farm and professional and service incomes. This added purchasing power would generate still further increases in spending and incomes. … The initial rise of $9 billion, plus this extra consumption spending and extra output of consumer goods, would add over $18 billion to our annual GDP.”</p>

                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p11">We can summarize this continuing process by saying that a “multiplier” of approximately 2 has been applied to the direct increment of consumption spending.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p12">Mr. Heller also predicted that proposed cuts in corporate income tax rates would increase investment by about $6 billion. The total change in autonomous aggregate expenditures would thus be $15 billion: $9 billion in consumption and $6 billion in investment. He predicted that the total increase in equilibrium GDP would be $30 billion, the amount the Council of Economic Advisers had estimated would be necessary to reach full employment.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch13_s02_s02_s02_p13">In the end, the tax cut was not passed until 1964, after President Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. While the Council of Economic Advisers concluded that the tax cut had worked as advertised, it came long after the economy had recovered and tended to push the economy into an inflationary gap. As we will see in later chapters, the tax cut helped push the economy into a period of rising inflation.</p>
