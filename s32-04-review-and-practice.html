        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch14_s04_p01">Investment is an addition to the capital stock. Investment may occur as a net addition to capital or as a replacement of depreciated capital. The bulk of investment spending in the United States falls into the latter category. Investment is a highly volatile component of GDP.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch14_s04_p02">The decision to save is linked directly to the decision to invest. If a nation is to devote a larger share of its production to investment, then it must devote a smaller share to consumption, all other things unchanged. And that requires people to save more.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch14_s04_p03">Investment is affected by the interest rate; the negative relationship between investment and the interest rate is illustrated by the investment demand curve. The position of this curve is affected by expectations, the level of economic activity, the stock of capital, the price of capital, the prices of other factors, technology, and public policy.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch14_s04_p04">Because investment is a component of aggregate demand, a change in investment shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right or left. The amount of the shift will equal the initial change in investment times the multiplier.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch14_s04_p05">In addition to its impact on aggregate demand, investment can also affect economic growth. Investment shifts the production possibilities curve outward, shifts the economy’s aggregate production function upward, and shifts the long-run aggregate supply curve to the right.</p>

                <ol class="orderedlist" id="rittenmacro-ch14_s04_l02" numeration="loweralpha">
                    <li>General Motors issues 1 million shares of stock.</li>
                    <li>Consolidated Construction purchases 1,000 acres of land for a regional shopping center it plans to build in a few years.</li>
                    <li>A K-Mart store adds 1,000 T-shirts to its inventory.</li>

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If saving dropped sharply in the economy, what would likely happen to investment? Why?</li>
            <li>Suppose local governments throughout the United States increase their tax on business inventories. What would you expect to happen to U.S. investment? Why?</li>
            <li>Suppose the government announces it will pay for half of any new investment undertaken by firms. How will this affect the investment demand curve?</li>
            <li>White House officials often exude more confidence than they actually feel about future prospects for the economy. Why might this be a good strategy? Are there any dangers inherent in it?</li>
            <li>Suppose everyone expects investment to rise sharply in three months. How would this expectation be likely to affect bond prices?</li>
            <li>Suppose that every increase of $1 in real GDP automatically stimulates $0.20 in additional investment spending. How would this affect the multiplier?</li>
            <li>If environmental resources were counted as part of the capital stock, how would a major forest fire affect net investment?</li>
            <li>In the Case in Point on reducing private capital in the Great Depression, we saw that net investment was negative during that period. Could gross investment ever be negative? Explain.</li>
            <li>The Case in Point on lowering the tax rate for one year for companies that repatriated profits suggests that investment did not increase, even though company representatives are quoted as saying that they were using the repatriated profits for investment. Explain this seeming contradiction.</li>
            <li>Use the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply to evaluate the argument that an increase in investment would raise the standard of living.</li>
