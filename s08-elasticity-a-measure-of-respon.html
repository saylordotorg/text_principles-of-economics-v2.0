        <p class="para editable block" id="e73.rittenberg-ch05_s00_p01">Imagine that you are the manager of the public transportation system for a large metropolitan area. Operating costs for the system have soared in the last few years, and you are under pressure to boost revenues. What do you do?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e74.rittenberg-ch05_s00_p02">An obvious choice would be to raise fares. That will make your customers angry, but at least it will generate the extra revenue you need—or will it? The law of demand says that raising fares will reduce the number of passengers riding on your system. If the number of passengers falls only a little, then the higher fares that your remaining passengers are paying might produce the higher revenues you need. But what if the number of passengers falls by so much that your higher fares actually reduce your revenues? If that happens, you will have made your customers mad and your financial problem worse!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e75.rittenberg-ch05_s00_p03">Maybe you should recommend <em class="emphasis">lower</em> fares. After all, the law of demand also says that lower fares will increase the number of passengers. Having more people use the public transportation system could more than offset a lower fare you collect from each person. But it might not. What <em class="emphasis">will</em> you do?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e76.rittenberg-ch05_s00_p04">Your job and the fiscal health of the public transit system are riding on your making the correct decision. To do so, you need to know just how responsive the quantity demanded is to a price change. You need a measure of responsiveness.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="e77.rittenberg-ch05_s00_p05">Economists use a measure of responsiveness called elasticity. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Elasticity</a><span class="glossdef">The ratio of the percentage change in a dependent variable to a percentage change in an independent variable.</span></span> is the ratio of the percentage change in a dependent variable to a percentage change in an independent variable.

        <p class="para editable block" id="e81.rittenberg-ch05_s00_p07">As manager of the public transit system, for example, you will want to know how responsive the number of passengers on your system (the dependent variable) will be to a change in fares (the independent variable). The concept of elasticity will help you solve your public transit pricing problem and a great many other issues in economics. We will examine several elasticities in this chapter—all will tell us how responsive one variable is to a change in another.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_p01">We know from the law of demand how the quantity demanded will respond to a price change: it will change in the opposite direction. But how <em class="emphasis">much</em> will it change? It seems reasonable to expect, for example, that a 10% change in the price charged for a visit to the doctor would yield a different percentage change in quantity demanded than a 10% change in the price of a Ford Mustang.

    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_p03">Because the price elasticity of demand shows the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a price change, assuming that other factors that influence demand are unchanged, it reflects movements <em class="emphasis">along</em> a demand curve. With a downward-sloping demand curve, price and quantity demanded move in opposite directions, so the price elasticity of demand is always negative. A positive percentage change in price implies a negative percentage change in quantity demanded, and vice versa. Sometimes you will see the absolute value of the price elasticity measure reported. In essence, the minus sign is ignored because it is expected that there will be a negative (inverse) relationship between quantity demanded and price. In this text, however, we will retain the minus sign in reporting price elasticity of demand and will say “the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand” when that is what we are describing.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Heads Up!</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_p04">Be careful not to confuse elasticity with slope. The slope of a line is the change in the value of the variable on the vertical axis divided by the change in the value of the variable on the horizontal axis between two points. Elasticity is the ratio of the percentage changes. The slope of a demand curve, for example, is the ratio of the change in price to the change in quantity between two points on the curve. The price elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity to the percentage change in price. As we will see, when computing elasticity at different points on a linear demand curve, the slope is constant—that is, it does not change—but the value for elasticity will change.</p>

Suppose the initial price is $0.80, and the quantity demanded is 40,000 rides per day; we are at point A on the curve. Now suppose the price falls to $0.70, and we want to report the responsiveness of the quantity demanded. We see that at the new price, the quantity demanded rises to 60,000 rides per day (point B). To compute the elasticity, we need to compute the percentage changes in price and in quantity demanded between points A and B.</p>

The percentage change in quantity, then, is 20,000/50,000, or 40%. Likewise, the percentage change in price between points A and B is based on the <em class="emphasis">average</em> of the two prices: ($0.80 + $0.70)/2 = $0.75, and so we have a percentage change of −0.10/0.75, or −13.33%. The price elasticity of demand between points A and B is thus 40%/(−13.33%) = −3.00.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s01_p04">This measure of elasticity, which is based on percentage changes relative to the average value of each variable between two points, is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">arc elasticity</a><span class="glossdef">Measure of elasticity based on percentage changes relative to the average value of each variable between two points.</span></span>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s01_p08">The arc elasticity method gives us an estimate of elasticity. It gives the value of elasticity at the midpoint over a range of change, such as the movement between points A and B. For a precise computation of elasticity, we would need to consider the response of a dependent variable to an extremely small change in an independent variable. The fact that arc elasticities are approximate suggests an important practical rule in calculating arc elasticities: we should consider only small changes in independent variables. We cannot apply the concept of arc elasticity to large changes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s01_p09">Another argument for considering only small changes in computing price elasticities of demand will become evident in the next section. We will investigate what happens to price elasticities as we move from one point to another along a linear demand curve.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Heads Up!</h3>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s01_p10">Notice that in the arc elasticity formula, the method for computing a percentage change differs from the standard method with which you may be familiar. That method measures the percentage change in a variable relative to its original value. For example, using the standard method, when we go from point A to point B, we would compute the percentage change in quantity as 20,000/40,000 = 50%. The percentage change in price would be −$0.10/$0.80 = −12.5%. The price elasticity of demand would then be 50%/(−12.5%) = −4.00. Going from point B to point A, however, would yield a different elasticity. The percentage change in quantity would be −20,000/60,000, or −33.33%. The percentage change in price would be $0.10/$0.70 = 14.29%. The price elasticity of demand would thus be −33.33%/14.29% = −2.33. By using the average quantity and average price to calculate percentage changes, the arc elasticity approach avoids the necessity to specify the direction of the change and, thereby, gives us the same answer whether we go from A to B or from B to A.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s02_p01">What happens to the price elasticity of demand when we travel along the demand curve? The answer depends on the nature of the demand curve itself. On a linear demand curve, such as the one in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch05_s02_s02_f01">Figure 5.2 "Price Elasticities of Demand for a Linear Demand Curve"</a>, elasticity becomes smaller (in absolute value) as we travel downward and to the right.</p>

We have already calculated the price elasticity of demand between points A and B; it equals −3.00. Notice, however, that when we use the same method to compute the price elasticity of demand between other sets of points, our answer varies. For each of the pairs of points shown, the changes in price and quantity demanded are the same (a $0.10 decrease in price and 20,000 additional rides per day, respectively). But at the high prices and low quantities on the upper part of the demand curve, the percentage change in quantity is relatively large, whereas the percentage change in price is relatively small. The absolute value of the price elasticity of demand is thus relatively large. As we move down the demand curve, equal changes in quantity represent smaller and smaller percentage changes, whereas equal changes in price represent larger and larger percentage changes, and the absolute value of the elasticity measure declines. Between points C and D, for example, the price elasticity of demand is −1.00, and between points E and F the price elasticity of demand is −0.33.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s03_p01">Suppose the public transit authority is considering raising fares. Will its total revenues go up or down? <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Total revenue</a><span class="glossdef">A firm’s output multiplied by the price at which it sells that output.</span></span> is the price per unit times the number of units sold.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-rittenberg-fn05_001">Notice that since the number of units sold of a good is the same as the number of units bought, the definition for total revenue could also be used to define total spending. Which term we use depends on the question at hand. If we are trying to determine what happens to revenues of sellers, then we are asking about total revenue. If we are trying to determine how much consumers spend, then we are asking about total spending.</span> In this case, it is the fare times the number of riders. The transit authority will certainly want to know whether a price increase will cause its total revenue to rise or fall. In fact, determining the impact of a price change on total revenue is crucial to the analysis of many problems in economics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s03_p02">We will do two quick calculations before generalizing the principle involved. Given the demand curve shown in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch05_s02_s02_f01">Figure 5.2 "Price Elasticities of Demand for a Linear Demand Curve"</a>, we see that at a price of $0.80, the transit authority will sell 40,000 rides per day. Total revenue would be $32,000 per day ($0.80 times 40,000). If the price were lowered by $0.10 to $0.70, quantity demanded would increase to 60,000 rides and total revenue would increase to $42,000 ($0.70 times 60,000). The reduction in fare <em class="emphasis">increases</em> total revenue. However, if the initial price had been $0.30 and the transit authority reduced it by $0.10 to $0.20, total revenue would <em class="emphasis">decrease</em> from $42,000 ($0.30 times 140,000) to $32,000 ($0.20 times 160,000). So it appears that the impact of a price change on total revenue depends on the initial price and, by implication, the original elasticity. We generalize this point in the remainder of this section.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s03_p03">The problem in assessing the impact of a price change on total revenue of a good or service is that a change in price always changes the quantity demanded in the opposite direction. An increase in price reduces the quantity demanded, and a reduction in price increases the quantity demanded. The question is how much. Because total revenue is found by multiplying the price per unit times the quantity demanded, it is not clear whether a change in price will cause total revenue to rise or fall.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s03_p04">We have already made this point in the context of the transit authority. Consider the following three examples of price increases for gasoline, pizza, and diet cola.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s03_p05">Suppose that 1,000 gallons of gasoline per day are demanded at a price of $4.00 per gallon. Total revenue for gasoline thus equals $4,000 per day (=1,000 gallons per day times $4.00 per gallon). If an increase in the price of gasoline to $4.25 reduces the quantity demanded to 950 gallons per day, total revenue rises to $4,037.50 per day (=950 gallons per day times $4.25 per gallon). Even though people consume less gasoline at $4.25 than at $4.00, total revenue rises because the higher price more than makes up for the drop in consumption.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s03_p06">Next consider pizza. Suppose 1,000 pizzas per week are demanded at a price of $9 per pizza. Total revenue for pizza equals $9,000 per week (=1,000 pizzas per week times $9 per pizza). If an increase in the price of pizza to $10 per pizza reduces quantity demanded to 900 pizzas per week, total revenue will still be $9,000 per week (=900 pizzas per week times $10 per pizza). Again, when price goes up, consumers buy less, but this time there is no change in total revenue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s03_p07">Now consider diet cola. Suppose 1,000 cans of diet cola per day are demanded at a price of $0.50 per can. Total revenue for diet cola equals $500 per day (=1,000 cans per day times $0.50 per can). If an increase in the price of diet cola to $0.55 per can reduces quantity demanded to 880 cans per month, total revenue for diet cola falls to $484 per day (=880 cans per day times $0.55 per can). As in the case of gasoline, people will buy less diet cola when the price rises from $0.50 to $0.55, but in this example total revenue drops.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s03_p08">In our first example, an increase in price increased total revenue. In the second, a price increase left total revenue unchanged. In the third example, the price rise reduced total revenue. Is there a way to predict how a price change will affect total revenue? There is; the effect depends on the price elasticity of demand.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s03_s02_p01">When the price of a good or service changes, the quantity demanded changes in the opposite direction. Total revenue will move in the direction of the variable that changes by the larger percentage. If the variables move by the same percentage, total revenue stays the same. If quantity demanded changes by a larger percentage than price (i.e., if demand is price elastic), total revenue will change in the direction of the quantity change. If price changes by a larger percentage than quantity demanded (i.e., if demand is price inelastic), total revenue will move in the direction of the price change. If price and quantity demanded change by the same percentage (i.e., if demand is unit price elastic), then total revenue does not change.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s03_s02_p02">When demand is price inelastic, a given percentage change in price results in a smaller percentage change in quantity demanded.

In the example above, 1,000 gallons of gasoline were purchased each day at a price of $4.00 per gallon; an increase in price to $4.25 per gallon reduced the quantity demanded to 950 gallons per day. We thus had an average quantity of 975 gallons per day and an average price of $4.125. We can thus calculate the arc price elasticity of demand for gasoline:</p>

If there are lots of substitutes for a particular good or service, then it is easy for consumers to switch to those substitutes when there is a price increase for that good or service. Suppose, for example, that the price of Ford automobiles goes up. There are many close substitutes for Fords—Chevrolets, Chryslers, Toyotas, and so on. The availability of close substitutes tends to make the demand for Fords more price elastic.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s01_p02">If a good has no close substitutes, its demand is likely to be somewhat less price elastic. There are no close substitutes for gasoline, for example. The price elasticity of demand for gasoline in the intermediate term of, say, three–nine months is generally estimated to be about −0.5. Since the absolute value of price elasticity is less than 1, it is price inelastic. We would expect, though, that the demand for a particular brand of gasoline will be much more price elastic than the demand for gasoline in general.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Importance in Household Budgets</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s02_p01">One reason price changes affect quantity demanded is that they change how much a consumer can buy; a change in the price of a good or service affects the purchasing power of a consumer’s income and thus affects the amount of a good the consumer will buy. This effect is stronger when a good or service is important in a typical household’s budget.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s02_p02">A change in the price of jeans, for example, is probably more important in your budget than a change in the price of pencils. Suppose the prices of both were to double. You had planned to buy four pairs of jeans this year, but now you might decide to make do with two new pairs. A change in pencil prices, in contrast, might lead to very little reduction in quantity demanded simply because pencils are not likely to loom large in household budgets. The greater the importance of an item in household budgets, the greater the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand is likely to be.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s03_p01">Suppose the price of electricity rises tomorrow morning. What will happen to the quantity demanded?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s03_p02">The answer depends in large part on how much time we allow for a response. If we are interested in the reduction in quantity demanded by tomorrow afternoon, we can expect that the response will be very small. But if we give consumers a year to respond to the price change, we can expect the response to be much greater. We expect that the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand will be greater when more time is allowed for consumer responses.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s03_p03">Consider the price elasticity of crude oil demand. Economist John C. B. Cooper estimated short- and long-run price elasticities of demand for crude oil for 23 industrialized nations for the period 1971–2000. Professor Cooper found that for virtually every country, the price elasticities were negative, and the long-run price elasticities were generally much greater (in absolute value) than were the short-run price elasticities. His results are reported in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s03_t01">Table 5.1 "Short- and Long-Run Price Elasticities of the Demand for Crude Oil in 23 Countries"</a>. As you can see, the research was reported in a journal published by OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries), an organization whose members have profited greatly from the inelasticity of demand for their product. By restricting supply, OPEC, which produces about 45% of the world’s crude oil, is able to put upward pressure on the price of crude. That increases OPEC’s (and all other oil producers’) total revenues and reduces total costs.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Case in Point: Elasticity and Stop Lights</h3>

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s03_p15">We all face the situation every day. You are approaching an intersection. The yellow light comes on. You know that you are supposed to slow down, but you are in a bit of a hurry. So, you speed up a little to try to make the light. But the red light flashes on just before you get to the intersection. Should you risk it and go through?</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s03_p16">Many people faced with that situation take the risky choice. In 1998, 2,000 people in the United States died as a result of drivers running red lights at intersections. In an effort to reduce the number of drivers who make such choices, many areas have installed cameras at intersections. Drivers who run red lights have their pictures taken and receive citations in the mail. This enforcement method, together with recent increases in the fines for driving through red lights at intersections, has led to an intriguing application of the concept of elasticity. Economists Avner Bar-Ilan of the University of Haifa in Israel and Bruce Sacerdote of Dartmouth University have estimated what is, in effect, the price elasticity for driving through stoplights with respect to traffic fines at intersections in Israel and in San Francisco.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s03_p17">In December 1996, Israel sharply increased the fine for driving through a red light. The old fine of 400 shekels (this was equal at that time to $122 in the United States) was increased to 1,000 shekels ($305). In January 1998, California raised its fine for the offense from $104 to $271. The country of Israel and the city of San Francisco installed cameras at several intersections. Drivers who ignored stoplights got their pictures taken and automatically received citations imposing the new higher fines.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s03_p18">We can think of driving through red lights as an activity for which there is a demand—after all, ignoring a red light speeds up one’s trip. It may also generate satisfaction to people who enjoy disobeying traffic laws. The concept of elasticity gives us a way to show just how responsive drivers were to the increase in fines.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s03_p19">Professors Bar-Ilan and Sacerdote obtained information on all the drivers cited at 73 intersections in Israel and eight intersections in San Francisco. For Israel, for example, they defined the period January 1992 to June 1996 as the “before” period. They compared the number of violations during the before period to the number of violations from July 1996 to December 1999—the “after” period—and found there was a reduction in tickets per driver of 31.5 per cent. Specifically, the average number of tickets per driver was 0.073 during the period before the increase; it fell to 0.050 after the increase. The increase in the fine was 150 per cent. (Note that, because they were making a “before” and “after” calculation, the authors used the standard method described in the Heads Up! on computing a percentage change—i.e., they computed the percentage changes in comparison to the original values instead of the average value of the variables.) The elasticity of citations with respect to the fine was thus −0.21 <span class="inlineequation"><span class="mathphrase">(= −31.5%/150%).</span>

                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s03_p20">The economists estimated elasticities for particular groups of people. For example, young people (age 17–30) had an elasticity of −0.36; people over the age of 30 had an elasticity of −0.16. In general, elasticities fell in absolute value as income rose. For San Francisco and Israel combined, the elasticity was between −0.26 and −0.33.</p>
                <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s02_s05_s03_p21">In general, the results showed that people responded rationally to the increases in fines. Increasing the price of a particular behavior reduced the frequency of that behavior. The study also points out the effectiveness of cameras as an enforcement technique. With cameras, violators can be certain they will be cited if they ignore a red light. And reducing the number of people running red lights clearly saves lives.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s03_s01_p02">The symbol <em class="emphasis">Y</em> is often used in economics to represent income. Because income elasticity of demand reports the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in income, all other things unchanged (including the price of the good), it reflects a shift in the demand curve at a given price. Remember that price elasticity of demand reflects movements <em class="emphasis">along</em> a demand curve in response to a change in price.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s03_s01_p03">A positive income elasticity of demand means that income and demand move in the same direction—an increase in income increases demand, and a reduction in income reduces demand. As we learned, a good whose demand rises as income rises is called a normal good.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s03_s01_p04">Studies show that most goods and services are normal, and thus their income elasticities are positive. Goods and services for which demand is likely to move in the same direction as income include housing, seafood, rock concerts, and medical services.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s03_s01_p05">If a good or service is inferior, then an increase in income reduces demand for the good. That implies a negative income elasticity of demand. Goods and services for which the income elasticity of demand is likely to be negative include used clothing, beans, and urban public transit. For example, the studies we have already cited concerning the demands for urban public transit in France and in Madrid found the long-run income elasticities of demand to be negative (−0.23 in France and −0.25 in Madrid).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-rittenberg-fn05_003">See Georges Bresson, Joyce Dargay, Jean-Loup Madre, and Alain Pirotte, “Economic and Structural Determinants of the Demand for French Transport: An Analysis on a Panel of French Urban Areas Using Shrinkage Estimators.” <em class="emphasis">Transportation Research: Part A</em> 38: 4 (May 2004): 269–285.

            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s03_s02_p12">Peruse the milk display at any supermarket and you will see a number of items that you would not have seen a decade ago. Choices include fat content; with or without lactose; animal milks or milk substitutes, such as soy or almond milk; flavors; and organic or conventional milk. Whereas in the 1990s only specialty stores stocked organic milk, today it is readily available in most supermarkets. In fact, the market share for organic milk has grown, as sales of conventional milk have been fairly constant while sales of organic milk have increased.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s03_s02_p13">Professors Pedro Alviola and Oral Capps have estimated various demand elasticities associated with conventional and organic milk, based on a study of 38,000 households. Their results are summarized in the following table.</p>

            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s03_s02_p14">Organic milk is price elastic, while conventional milk is price inelastic. Both cross-price elasticities are positive, indicating that these two kinds of milk are substitutes but their estimated values differ. In particular, a 1% increase in the price of conventional milk leads to a 0.70% increase in the quantity demanded of organic milk, while a 1% increase in the price of organic milk leads to an increase in the quantity demanded of conventional milk of only 0.18%. This asymmetry suggests that organic milk consumers have considerable reluctance in switching back to what they may perceive as a lower-quality product. Finally, the income elasticity estimates suggest that organic milk is a normal good, while conventional milk is an inferior good. As might be expected, in the sample used in the study, purchasers of organic milk are more affluent as a group than are purchasers of conventional milk.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s03_s02_p15">Being a fairly new product, organic milk studies are just becoming available and the authors point out that other researchers using different data sets have calculated different values for these elasticities.

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s04_s01_p01">Time plays a very important role in the determination of the price elasticity of supply. Look again at the effect of rent increases on the supply of apartments. Suppose apartment rents in a city rise. If we are looking at a supply curve of apartments over a period of a few months, the rent increase is likely to induce apartment owners to rent out a relatively small number of additional apartments. With the higher rents, apartment owners may be more vigorous in reducing their vacancy rates, and, indeed, with more people looking for apartments to rent, this should be fairly easy to accomplish. Attics and basements are easy to renovate and rent out as additional units. In a short period of time, however, the supply response is likely to be fairly modest, implying that the price elasticity of supply is fairly low. A supply curve corresponding to a short period of time would look like <em class="emphasis">S</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> in <a class="xref" href="#rittenberg-ch05_s04_f01">Figure 5.5 "Increase in Apartment Rents Depends on How Responsive Supply Is"</a>.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Elasticity of Labor Supply: A Special Application</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s04_s02_p01">The concept of price elasticity of supply can be applied to labor to show how the quantity of labor supplied responds to changes in wages or salaries. What makes this case interesting is that it has sometimes been found that the measured elasticity is negative, that is, that an increase in the wage rate is associated with a reduction in the quantity of labor supplied.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenberg-ch05_s04_s02_p02">In most cases, labor supply curves have their normal upward slope: higher wages induce people to work more. For them, having the additional income from working more is preferable to having more leisure time. However, wage increases may lead some people in very highly paid jobs to cut back on the number of hours they work because their incomes are already high and they would rather have more time for leisure activities. In this case, the labor supply curve would have a negative slope. The reasons for this phenomenon are explained more fully in a later chapter. The Case in Point in this section gives another example where an increase in the wage may reduce the number of hours of work.</p>

                <li>The price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to changes in price. It is the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price. It is usually positive.</li>
                <li>Supply is price inelastic if the price elasticity of supply is less than 1; it is unit price elastic if the price elasticity of supply is equal to 1; and it is price elastic if the price elasticity of supply is greater than 1. A vertical supply curve is said to be perfectly inelastic. A horizontal supply curve is said to be perfectly elastic.</li>
                <li>The price elasticity of supply is greater when the length of time under consideration is longer because over time producers have more options for adjusting to the change in price.</li>
                <li>When applied to labor supply, the price elasticity of supply is usually positive but can be negative. If higher wages induce people to work more, the labor supply curve is upward sloping and the price elasticity of supply is positive. In some very high-paying professions or other unusual circumstances, the labor supply curve may have a negative slope, which leads to a negative price elasticity of supply.</li>

            <h3 class="title">Case in Point: Child Labor in Pakistan</h3>

            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s04_s02_p09">Professor Sonia Bhalotra investigated the role of household poverty in child labor. Imagine a household with two parents and two children, a boy and a girl. If only the parents work, the family income may be less than an amount required for subsistence. In order to at least raise the income of the family to subsistence, will the labor of both children be added? If only one child will work, will it be the boy or the girl? How do the motivations of parents to send their children to work affect the design of policies to encourage education? Will a program that reduces school fees or improves school quality lead to more education or would a program that provides cash or food to households who send their children to school work better?</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s04_s02_p10">Using information on over 3,000 children in an area of rural Pakistan where their labor force participation is high, child wage labor is common, and gender differences in education and work of children prevail, Professor Bhalotra specifically estimated how changes in wages for boys and girls affect the number of hours they work. She focused on wage work outside the home because it usually involves more hours and less flexibility than, say, work on one’s own farm, which essentially rules out going to school. </p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s04_s02_p11">She argues that if the work of a child is geared toward the family hitting a target level of income, then an increase in the wage will lead to fewer hours of work. That is, the labor supply elasticity will be negative and the labor supply curve will have a negative slope. For boys, she finds that the wage elasticity is about −0.5. For girls, she finds that the wage elasticity is about 0, meaning the labor supply curve is vertical. To further her hypothesis that the labor supply decision for boys but not for girls is compelled by household poverty, she notes that separate estimates show that the income of the family from sources other than having their children work reduces the amount that boys work but has no effect on the amount that girls work. Other research she has undertaken on labor supply of children on household-run farms provides further support for these gender differences: Girls from families that own relatively larger farms were both more likely to work and less likely to go to school than girls from households with farms of smaller acreage.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s04_s02_p12">Why the gender differences and how do these findings affect drafting of policies to encourage schooling? For boys, cash or food given to households could induce parents to send their sons to school. For girls, household poverty reduction may not work. Their relatively lower level of participating in schooling may be related to an expected low impact of education on their future wages. Expectations about when they will get married and whether or not they should work as adults, especially if it means moving to other areas, may also play a role. For girls, policies that alter attitudes toward girls’ education and in the longer term affect educated female adult earnings may be more instrumental in increasing their educational attainment.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s05_p01">This chapter introduced a new tool: the concept of elasticity. Elasticity is a measure of the degree to which a dependent variable responds to a change in an independent variable. It is the percentage change in the dependent variable divided by the percentage change in the independent variable, all other things unchanged.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s05_p02">The most widely used elasticity measure is the price elasticity of demand, which reflects the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price. Demand is said to be price elastic if the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, unit price elastic if it is equal to 1, and price inelastic if it is less than 1. The price elasticity of demand is useful in forecasting the response of quantity demanded to price changes; it is also useful for predicting the impact a price change will have on total revenue. Total revenue moves in the direction of the quantity change if demand is price elastic, it moves in the direction of the price change if demand is price inelastic, and it does not change if demand is unit price elastic. The most important determinants of the price elasticity of demand are the availability of substitutes, the importance of the item in household budgets, and time.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s05_p03">Two other elasticity measures commonly used in conjunction with demand are income elasticity and cross price elasticity. The signs of these elasticity measures play important roles. A positive income elasticity tells us that a good is normal; a negative income elasticity tells us the good is inferior. A positive cross price elasticity tells us that two goods are substitutes; a negative cross price elasticity tells us they are complements.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s05_p04">Elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to changes in price. The value of price elasticity of supply is generally positive. Supply is classified as being price elastic, unit price elastic, or price inelastic if price elasticity is greater than 1, equal to 1, or less than 1, respectively. The length of time over which supply is being considered is an important determinant of the price elasticity of supply.</p>
