        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s05_p01">This chapter introduced a new tool: the concept of elasticity. Elasticity is a measure of the degree to which a dependent variable responds to a change in an independent variable. It is the percentage change in the dependent variable divided by the percentage change in the independent variable, all other things unchanged.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s05_p02">The most widely used elasticity measure is the price elasticity of demand, which reflects the responsiveness of quantity demanded to changes in price. Demand is said to be price elastic if the absolute value of the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, unit price elastic if it is equal to 1, and price inelastic if it is less than 1. The price elasticity of demand is useful in forecasting the response of quantity demanded to price changes; it is also useful for predicting the impact a price change will have on total revenue. Total revenue moves in the direction of the quantity change if demand is price elastic, it moves in the direction of the price change if demand is price inelastic, and it does not change if demand is unit price elastic. The most important determinants of the price elasticity of demand are the availability of substitutes, the importance of the item in household budgets, and time.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s05_p03">Two other elasticity measures commonly used in conjunction with demand are income elasticity and cross price elasticity. The signs of these elasticity measures play important roles. A positive income elasticity tells us that a good is normal; a negative income elasticity tells us the good is inferior. A positive cross price elasticity tells us that two goods are substitutes; a negative cross price elasticity tells us they are complements.</p>
        <p class="para" id="rittenberg-ch05_s05_p04">Elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to changes in price. The value of price elasticity of supply is generally positive. Supply is classified as being price elastic, unit price elastic, or price inelastic if price elasticity is greater than 1, equal to 1, or less than 1, respectively. The length of time over which supply is being considered is an important determinant of the price elasticity of supply.</p>

            <li>Explain why the price elasticity of demand is generally a negative number, except in the cases where the demand curve is perfectly elastic or perfectly inelastic. What would be implied by a positive price elasticity of demand?</li>
            <li>Explain why the sign (positive or negative) of the cross price elasticity of demand is important.</li>
            <li>Explain why the sign (positive or negative) of the income elasticity of demand is important.</li>
            <li>Economists Dale Heien and Cathy Roheim Wessells found that the price elasticity of demand for fresh milk is −0.63 and the price elasticity of demand for cottage cheese is −1.1.<span class="footnote" id="rittenberg-5564-20111128-145540-245128">Dale M. Heien and Cathy Roheim Wessels, “The Demand for Dairy Products: Structure, Prediction, and Decomposition,” <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Agricultural Economics</em> 70:2 (May 1988): 219–228.</span> Why do you think the elasticity estimates differ?</li>
            <li>The price elasticity of demand for health care has been estimated to be −0.2. Characterize this demand as price elastic, unit price elastic, or price inelastic. The text argues that the greater the importance of an item in consumer budgets, the greater its elasticity. Health-care costs account for a relatively large share of household budgets. How could the price elasticity of demand for health care be such a small number?</li>
            <li>Suppose you are able to organize an alliance that includes all farmers. They agree to follow the group’s instructions with respect to the quantity of agricultural products they produce. What might the group seek to do? Why?</li>
            <li>Suppose you are the chief executive officer of a firm, and you have been planning to reduce your prices. Your marketing manager reports that the price elasticity of demand for your product is −0.65. How will this news affect your plans?</li>
            <li>Suppose the income elasticity of the demand for beans is −0.8. Interpret this number.</li>
            <li>Transportation economists generally agree that the cross price elasticity of demand for automobile use with respect to the price of bus fares is about 0. Explain what this number means.</li>
            <li>Suppose the price elasticity of supply of tomatoes as measured on a given day in July is 0. Interpret this number.</li>
            <li>The price elasticity of supply for child-care workers has been estimated to be quite high, about 2. What will happen to the wages of child-care workers as demand for them increases, compared to what would happen if the measured price elasticity of supply were lower?</li>
            <li>Studies suggest that a higher tax on cigarettes would reduce teen smoking and premature deaths. Should cigarette taxes therefore be raised?</li>
