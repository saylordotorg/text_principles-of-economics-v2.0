    <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_p01">So far we have focused on how monetary policy affects real GDP and the price level in the short run. That is, we have examined how it can be used—however imprecisely—to close recessionary or inflationary gaps and to stabilize the price level. In this section, we will explore the relationship between money and the economy in the context of an equation that relates the money supply directly to nominal GDP. As we shall see, it also identifies circumstances in which changes in the price level are directly related to changes in the money supply.</p>

Each person has $10 in cash and no other money. The money supply of this economy is thus $500. Now suppose that the sole economic activity in this economy is car washing. Each person in the economy washes one other person’s car once a month, and the price of a car wash is $10. In one month, then, a total of 50 car washes are produced at a price of $10 each.

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s01_p10">The essential thing to note about the equation of exchange is that it always holds. That should come as no surprise. The left side, <em class="emphasis">MV</em>, gives the money supply times the number of times that money is spent on goods and services during a period. It thus measures total spending. The right side is nominal GDP. But that is a measure of total spending on goods and services as well. Nominal GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced during a particular period. Those goods and services are either sold or added to inventory. If they are sold, then they must be part of total spending. If they are added to inventory, then some firm must have either purchased them or paid for their production; they thus represent a portion of total spending. In effect, the equation of exchange says simply that total spending on goods and services, measured as <em class="emphasis">MV</em>, equals total spending on goods and services, measured as <em class="emphasis">PY</em> (or nominal GDP). The equation of exchange is thus an identity, a mathematical expression that is true by definition.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s01_p11">To apply the equation of exchange to a real economy, we need measures of each of the variables in it. Three of these variables are readily available. The Department of Commerce reports the price level (that is, the implicit price deflator) and real GDP.

        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s03_p03">The equation of exchange can thus be rewritten as an equation that expresses the demand for money as a percentage, given by 1/<em class="emphasis">V</em>, of nominal GDP. With a velocity of 1.87, for example, people wish to hold a quantity of money equal to 53.4% (1/1.87) of nominal GDP. Other things unchanged, an increase in money demand reduces velocity, and a decrease in money demand increases velocity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s03_p04">If people wanted to hold a quantity of money equal to a larger percentage of nominal GDP, perhaps because interest rates were low, velocity would be a smaller number. Suppose, for example, that people held a quantity of money equal to 80% of nominal GDP. That would imply a velocity of 1.25. If people held a quantity of money equal to a smaller fraction of nominal GDP, perhaps owing to high interest rates, velocity would be a larger number. If people held a quantity of money equal to 25% of nominal GDP, for example, the velocity would be 4.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s03_p05">As another example, in the chapter on financial markets and the economy, we learned that money demand falls when people expect inflation to increase. In essence, they do not want to hold money that they believe will only lose value, so they turn it over faster, that is, velocity rises. Expectations of deflation lower the velocity of money, as people hold onto money because they expect it will rise in value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s03_p06">In our first look at the equation of exchange, we noted some remarkable conclusions that would hold if velocity were constant: a given percentage change in the money supply <em class="emphasis">M</em> would produce an equal percentage change in nominal GDP, and no change in nominal GDP could occur without an equal percentage change in <em class="emphasis">M</em>. We have learned, however, that velocity varies in the short run. Thus, the conclusions that would apply if velocity were constant must be changed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s03_p07">First, we do not expect a given percentage change in the money supply to produce an equal percentage change in nominal GDP. Suppose, for example, that the money supply increases by 10%. Interest rates drop, and the quantity of money demanded goes up. Velocity is likely to decline, though not by as large a percentage as the money supply increases. The result will be a reduction in the degree to which a given percentage increase in the money supply boosts nominal GDP.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s03_p08">Second, nominal GDP could change even when there is no change in the money supply. Suppose government purchases increase. Such an increase shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right, increasing real GDP and the price level. That effect would be impossible if velocity were constant. The fact that velocity varies, and varies positively with the interest rate, suggests that an increase in government purchases could boost aggregate demand and nominal GDP. To finance increased spending, the government borrows money by selling bonds. An increased supply of bonds lowers their price, and that means higher interest rates. The higher interest rates produce the increase in velocity that must occur if increased government purchases are to boost the price level and real GDP.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s03_p09">Just as we cannot assume that velocity is constant when we look at macroeconomic behavior period to period, neither can we assume that output is at potential. With both <em class="emphasis">V</em> and <em class="emphasis">Y</em> in the equation of exchange variable, in the short run, the impact of a change in the money supply on the price level depends on the degree to which velocity and real GDP change.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s03_p10">In the short run, it is not reasonable to assume that velocity and output are constants. Using the model in which interest rates and other factors affect the quantity of money demanded seems more fruitful for understanding the impact of monetary policy on economic activity in that period. However, the empirical evidence on the long-run relationship between changes in money supply and changes in the price level that we presented earlier gives us reason to pause. As Federal Reserve Governor from 1996 to 2002 Laurence H. Meyer put it: “I believe monitoring money growth has value, even for central banks that follow a disciplined strategy of adjusting their policy rate to ongoing economic developments. The value may be particularly important at the extremes: during periods of very high inflation, as in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States … and in deflationary episodes.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-rittenmacro-fn11_005">Laurence H. Meyer, “Does Money Matter?” <em class="emphasis">Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review</em> 83, no. 5 (September/October 2001): 1–15.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s03_p11">It would be a mistake to allow short-term fluctuations in velocity and output to lead policy makers to completely ignore the relationship between money and price level changes in the long run.</p>

            <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s03_p13">The Union and the Confederacy financed their respective efforts during the Civil War largely through the issue of paper money. The Union roughly doubled its money supply through this process, and the Confederacy printed enough “Confederates” to increase the money supply in the South 20-fold from 1861 to 1865. That huge increase in the money supply boosted the price level in the Confederacy dramatically. It rose from an index of 100 in 1861 to 9,200 in 1865.</p>
            <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s03_p14">Estimates of real GDP in the South during the Civil War are unavailable, but it could hardly have increased very much. Although production undoubtedly rose early in the period, the South lost considerable capital and an appalling number of men killed in battle. Let us suppose that real GDP over the entire period remained constant. For the price level to rise 92-fold with a 20-fold increase in the money supply, there must have been a 4.6-fold increase in velocity. People in the South must have reduced their demand for Confederates.</p>

But if she had taken my offer of yarn! I haggle in yarn for the millionth part of a thread! … When they ask for Confederate money, I never stop to chafer [bargain or argue]. I give them 20 or 50 dollars cheerfully for anything.”</p>

            <p class="para" id="rittenmacro-ch11_s03_s03_p17">People in the South must have reduced their demand for money. The fall in money demand was probably due to the expectation that the price level would continue to rise. In periods of high inflation, people try to get rid of money quickly because it loses value rapidly.</p>
